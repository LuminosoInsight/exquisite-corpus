Apple has a strong, simple product line. Strong, because it is renewed once a year and because old products are phased out, Simple because there are only around 3 different product of each type (look at the lineup at Dell or Creative). (simplifies the selection process of the customer) The latest iPod changes have all brought a higher profit margin to the company. The assembly process has been tweaked the number of components have been reduced .. but not the sticker price: the \"starting at 249$\" sticker is always in use somewhere. Furthermore, Apple products have a tendency to stay at the  introduction price until the products are replaced by the next generation indicating that profit is stable throughout the entire (14 month) lifetime of a product.\n\nAAPL is around $185 a share at the moment, the dollar is weak, and the company is going to start selling iPhones in Europe (strong Euro) before Christmas. Granted, the share price might already indicate future sales.\n(If Jobs has another Product HiFi presentation .. buy like there is no tomorrow, because prices will take a fall, for a few days..)\n","controversiality":1,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1193203006,"score":5,"ups":5,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_5yyxr","id":"c02azc9","author_flair_text":null,"author":"frogking","retrieved_on":1473792298,"distinguished":null,"gilded":0}

Today and for the next few days they will be trading and taking their profits off the table.

As I wrote in another post, my feelings are that it becomes harder to feel sympathy for a girl who makes multiple bad decisions leading up to rapes. I would include \"being a prostitute\" and \"getting drunk with net strangers\" on this. I don't see this as thinking she shares the blame, as the blame for the rape lies on the rapist, but at the same time, we should ask women (and the feminist movement) to take into account good behavior before hand. \r\n\r\nLet me ask you. If you had a daughter, and you let her go off with a stranger had a gut feeling about in a bad way, to go off to a party, and she got raped, how would you feel? Would you wonder if you could have done anything different to change the outcome? If you do wonder, would that make you \"responsible\"? Sorry to be so personal, but this is a very sensitive topic. \r\n\r\nAlso, it *is* someones right to not get raped. 100% it is. An officer of the law should prosecute any and all listed assaults in the post. But rights can be violated, and it is a matter of taking steps to avoid violations.","controversiality":0}
