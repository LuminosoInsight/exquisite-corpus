program of study for solfege
by annette dieudonnée ( c . 1963 )
begin studies as early as possible ( 4 or 5 years old )
a . instill in the child at an early age the precise notion of the height of the sound by making him recognize isolated sounds ( natural notes within the octave ), then extend little by little the upper and lower ends of the scale by octaves .
then , begin in the same fashion the study of the altered notes .
b . at the same time , develop the auditory memory by having the child hear fragments at first very simple , conjunct and short , which should be sung afterwards by memory by the child who will then name the notes .
c . have the child also write the sounds he has heard and identified .
begin with the note values which are easiest to understand .
be careful right away that the child recognizes rhythmic groups as living entities by the musical shape and not as the result of calculations .
the arithmetic explanation of rhythmic values must be only a check of a rhythmic group which has already been learned .
here , in my opinion , is the best manner in which to proceed :
1 . the teacher plays the rhythm while the student reads it .
2 . the student repeats the rhythm from memory , by simple imitation .
3 . he repeats it again reading it .
4 . he learns to write it .
the book by g . dandelot , manuel pratique de l' étude des clés ( eschig ), is based , in my opinion , on the best system : learn by heart several notes ( reference points ), and fix little by little the other notes by relation to these reference points always insisting on the notion of the melodic interval which will be the same for all the clefs , being always a second , always a fifth , etc .
once the treble clef has been somewhat learned , begin the study of the bass clef following the same principles ; then , gradually , all the other clefs . avoid that the child should get used to thinking that this note is sol ; rather he should think that that could be any note depending on the sign placed at the beginning of the staff , that , in any case , this will be an ascending second , etc ... naturally , the study of notation should continue in parallel with the study of sight - reading .
this study must continue along with the ear training .
the child must be able to find without using the piano the intonation of all the notes that he can recognize .
once he can read a bit , make him solfege while singing , saying the names of the notes and beating the time .
panseron , a.b.c . musical ( good book for young children , because it does not exceed the range of their voices )
train the melodic memory by writing fragments after one hearing .
begin to play 2 sounds simultaneously .
dictation of perfect major and minor chords in four parts ; the student must simply say the key and the mode of the chord .
begin the study of vol 3 ( simultaneous rhythms ).
play the rhythms , repeat them from memory , and write them . one can also begin the study of the first two chapters of the admirable book by paul hindemith , elementary training for musicians ( schott ).
the teacher should use the recommended exercises as a model for composing a large number of similar exercises , to permit the student to familiarize himself sufficiently with the successive difficulties .
continue the study of the manuel pratique de g . dandelot by taking more difficult exercises in each clef and by increasing the tempo little by little .
begin the study of music theory .
g . becker - 20 leçons mélodiques ( leduc ) first part of vol 1
first , do dictations where the student will notate successively the bass , then the upper part , and then easier dictations where he will notate the two parts after one hearing .
noël - gallon , g . dandelot , lautier et maurice , g . becker , roger ducasse ( for advanced students ).
these chords can be connected or , on the contrary , heard separately .
dictations of such chords can be found at the end of the volume for 2 voices in g . becker ( cours complet de dictées musicales , leduc )
study also the harmonic dictations by noël - gallon ( 150 dictés harmoniques graduées à 2 , 3 , 4 parties ( jobert ))
do dictations of perfect , imperfect , broken , plagal , and dominant cadences , and simple modulations .
continue l' etude de rythme de dandelot vol 4 et 5 and hindemith ( chap 3 to 6 )
continue the study of the manuel pratique .
begin dictations in 3 and even 4 parts :
proceed as with the dictations in 2 parts ; besides the normal dictations where the student will note successively each voice , one should also do simple dictations where the student must notate the three voices after one hearing .
have the students learn by heart 3 - voice dictations ( learning them melodically , without playing them on an instrument ), then have them perform them by memory by playing the outer parts on the piano and singing , also by memory , the middle part .
dictations of all the chords of 3 , 4 , and 5 notes , root position or inverted , with or without accidentals ; and chords on a pedal tone .
dictations of this type can be found at the end of the collection of three - part dictations by becker and at the end of the harmonic dictations by noël - gallon , dictées de modulations éloignées , de toutes les cadences .
dictation of melodic fragments in the greek or transposed ecclesiastical modes . the student must recognize the mode and say into which key it has been transposed .
dictation and analysis of short fragments , the student being required , after hearing the fragment , to name the degrees and analyze the modulations .
finish the study of the hindemith elementary training , including the dictations .
( an excellent book , unfortunately out of print , i think , was schwartz exercices complémentaires de rythme )
begin sung transposition at sight , at any interval , of the exercises written in two clefs .
the transposition must be accomplished by reading in the different clefs and by putting into practice the rules of music theory and not by ear or by intervals , which would not give good results if the piece to be transposed presents difficulties or unexpected modulations or intervals .
begin the study of transposing instruments and of all the problems which this presents .
the student should know all the chords of 3 , 4 , and 5 notes , natural or altered , root position or inverted .
he should know the names and the figures of all the chords and of their inversions ; the keys and degrees to which they belong .
he should also know the mechanism of modulation , and the theory of ornamental notes : passing tones , ornaments , appoggiaturas , anticipations , delays , échappées , pedals ; and to be able to analyze harmonically simple chorales by j.s . bach , indicating figures , degrees , cadences , ornamental notes , modulations , etc .

they will permit women who are about to undergo surgery – and their partners – to imagine the change that is coming and to de - dramatize it . we have many emails thanking us for this category .
not just photos when coming out of the operating theatre , as we see too often …
humour and tenderness are welcome !
" i am 44 years old and was operated on in march 2010 .
the decision not to have reconstruction carried out was an entirely conscious one . my removed breasts will never be there again . i accept that in order to live and do not feel in any way less feminine .
" beautiful with only one breast …"
" to remain oneself , to save the tracks of the ordeal , stigma of the hard duel , that each time it is touched reveals its secret and brings us back to that day when we were so close to losing everything when suddenly life was reinvented rising from the ashes like a phoenix ".
nathalie , reconciled amazon , cyclops at peace
" alive and without « surgical reconstruction » i feel good !"
" once you have been confronted with a life or death situation little problematic things don't matter anymore , your perspective becomes much broader and you live life at a deeper level .
there is no time for insignificance ".
and i don't want to have a reconstruction : i have much more to do than to spend time between the hospital , medical care , pain and various risks !"
" thank you , beautiful bird , thanks to you i can now rest and savour the happiness of having remained a woman , even more feminine than before ".
to live with the irony and be proud of our courage !"

just a few words to congratulate you for the courage that i do not think i yet have but i'm working on it …
i will undergo surgery in mid - november or december , after five months of chemotherapy .
i do not yet know what to do and am exploring the surgical options for immediate reconstruction but i also admire how graciously you accept the situation .
this opens a door for me that i had not considered .
bravo for all these beautiful testimonies and photos .
how beautiful all these amazons are !!!

sébastien : my grandmother has become an amazon
a few weeks ago my grandmother discovered that she had cancer in her right breast .
i had never seen my grandmother in a hospital bed . i do not think i'd ever seen her with a common cold .
i've never seen a woman's breasts as an object of desire . so when i saw an amazon on tv i found her even more beautiful simply because she showed that she can be a mother with only one breast .
thanks you for your web site .
florence : today i'm fine …
i'm florence . it is now a year since i had breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy . only now can i say that i ' m fine …
but it all caught up with me … and i suffered a severe depression and that was when i was able to connect to the depths of my pain and i started to accept the situation .
the cancer has changed me deeply and i think today that i am fairer with myself , more tolerant , attentive and respectful towards others , my priorities have changed and i'm learning little by little now to let go and be confident .
but that's the lot of any ordeal , which beyond the suffering , connects us to our deepest selves .
emmanuelle : a little choreography for my children
everything went very fast when i needed surgery because i was quite young – i was 42 – and doctors do not want to lose a minute ; i could not – even if it had been possible – prepare my children .
these included my daughter marie who is the youngest and who , at that time was very young , 3 years old .
every day , for months , she told me how it was sad that i had only one breast .
she was afraid of losing me : with time , as in all important situations , my little girl's sadness faded away . now she never speaks of the missing breast . we go to the swimming pool together .
and it was clear that marie , in actual fact , was scared that i was going to disappear , and that she was speaking to me of her fear .
geraldine : mum , when will i have a breast , like you , that sticks on ?
first of all , i want to congratulate you for this site to which i can relate from several points of view . i had my cancer a year ago . following removal of the left breast i had 6 chemo and 25 sessions of radiotherapy .
i am currently on hormone therapy .
florence : an image of angels on my scar …
three months ago i underwent a mastectomy and in the middle of my inner storm , i found a haven of comfort by visiting your site .
without you i do not think the idea would have come to me .
valerie : a look at my ancestral amazons
my great - grand aunt was a delightful woman , patient and very close to us , her great - grand nephews and nieces .
she had no children , but she is the only one who really knew how to enjoy playing with me as a little girl : we used to get into my car ( a red beetle with black spots , of course ), where she would tirelessly and patiently tell me , ten times over if she thought it necessary , about my mother when she was small (" because , yes , your mother was also once a little girl ").
she had not given birth , but she knew how to give life to the family story . it is undoubtedly due to her spontaneity that i knew very quickly she had a " real breast " and a " fake breast ".
uninhibited , she regularly allowed me to feel her chest , so that i could guess which was the real breast and which one was false . on the latter , i could honk the horn … honk ! honk !
stéphane : the experience of a spouse , daring to touch
in the first instance it's in caressing caroline's breast that first i felt a small lump … the beginning of a long adventure .
after that , it was the chemo cycle , during which the whole family was subjected to the rhythm of the treatment ( once every 3 weeks ).
there , again , regular massage of the scar , not forgetting to cuddle the other breast at the same time … it's a strong emotional time together .
and during the last few months in order to alleviate pain in the legs , shoulders and neck , nothing was worth more than a good massage of the whole body . i really saw in caro's face and eyes all the good this simple relationship was doing to her , this touching and natural look , this support through contact of fingers and lips .
another thing that helped each of us equally was the strong desire to live normally when the effects of the treatment eased during the few days before the next chemo treatment : gentle sports , going outside , little trips . to live life to the full , to enjoy it … and continue on the road with plenty of energy to be " demolished " by the next session of treatment …
now , with chemo behind her , her health is coming back , the hair is beginning to grow again , we are loving all the happiness of it , and we continue our regular little tender massages to soften the scar … and have fun ! so for all of you who read my testimony , my advice to you would be : be daring , touch , massage , kiss , as soon as possible and as often as possible ! everyone reacts differently of course , but for us that was really the best !
i hope i have not been too longwinded and i'll be happy if my testimony can help some spouses to live through this unchosen adventure more simply and serenely and share it profoundly with their preferred amazon .
agnes : how i told my niece and my nephew and children around me about my breast cancer and my mastectomy … and also about my wig !
in january 2008 , at 30 years of age , i was operated on for breast cancer . i had a mastectomy , a lymph node dissection , chemotherapy , radio therapy and i take tamoxifen .
after taking advice from specialists , from former patients and from the parents of my niece and nephew , especially their mother , this is how things panned out … my niece louisa , and my nephew gustave , were 6 and 2 years old when i was diagnosed .
she was behind the door , curious and with her desire to " see ". i asked her if she wanted to see my scar , warning her that it was ugly ( which she confirmed to me !).
i showed her the prosthesis and she ended up playing with it !
the following summer , having been operated on six months earlier , i was getting out of the bath and my nephew sees me naked and points to my scar laughing and saying " oh , auntie !", i explained simply to him what had happened to me . i had integrated this new " breast " very well , so it did not pose a problem for me . i was just bemused .
with a knife , scissors , an axe , or a blade ? in february , thirteen months after the surgery , i was taking a bath with him and he sees my scar . he had obviously forgotten what he had already seen and what i had explained to him , and he asked me how the surgeon had removed the breast … " with a knife , scissors , an axe , or with a blade ?"
a really horrible phrase that continued to go on and on and on !!! his mother was the most uncomfortable of the two of us because of the violence of what her son had said , and tried to stop him ! but , there again , having perfectly accepted my new body , this didn't phase me , or at least didn't upset me at all . i managed to laugh with him . and we moved on to something else , simply and naturally .
the wig … it went like clockwork ! with regard to the wig , i was playing hairdressers with my niece . i must have wanted to tell her something and i provoked the situation … we discussed how to style my hair which had recently become short cut after the announcement of the disease , at a time when i had much longer hair … louisa was brushing my hair .
the wig starts to fall off and i throw myself back on the bed trying to hold it on but only half succeeding in doing so ! i burst out laughing . louisa with a look of terror and misunderstanding looks at her mother ( an expression from louisa that yolenne has never seen since ), she must have had the impression that she had done something really stupid , that she had scalped me … i then explained to her very naturally , in a joking manner and continuing to laugh ( forcing myself a little , no doubt ) that as the drugs were ruining my hair it had to be cut very , very short , and that as i did not like it , i preferred to wear a wig .
one day when i was holding the little brother of these girls , i said to the girl who was present that the plastic breast seemed as comfortable as the real one . " oh , you've a plastic breast ?"
this reassured them . they know that i have now recovered and are no longer worried about me as they see i'm in good form ( gustave never worried ).
and in addition that permits them to see me more often and i'm always available !
so i would recommend : truth , simplicity , naturalness , humour and no theatricals ! and this goes for children and for us , sick adults , around them ! as for my niece whose breasts are starting to develop , it will not be long , i think , before she covets my old prosthesis and those in cotton from the association " vivre comme avant "- " living like before "!
i'd rather be safe than suffer further lymph node dissection , chemo and radiotherapy and all their side effects ! and even if that means having to return to the operating table to undergo another anesthetic , i have decided to go ahead with a preventive ablation and bilateral reconstruction .

eva 2 : aerodynamic sensors
most of the sensors are fixed on a device called " mouthpiece "( patented device ):
subject position to record acoustic and aerodynamic data with the " mouthpiece "
flexible and pleasing to the skin , they allow a good airtightness and can support cleaning agents .
the nasal airflow sensor is placed vertically below the nostrils .
such a system allows a natural conduction of the air ( patented device ). different sizes of tubes are available , according to the subject nostrils .
they can be dismantled to be cleaned .
intra - oral pressure can be directly measured by slipping the catheter between the lips or through nasal tract . sub - glottic or oesophagian pressure can be measured simultaneously using an other catheter .
the eva2 ™ system measures airflow using a wide - range , grid pneumotachograph featuring low dead space and high linearity . with a 1 l / s airflow , grid resistance is about 10 pa , which is equivalent to 1 / 100 of a standard sub - glottic pressure ( 10 hpa ).
so , the load caused by the grid is very low .
technical specifications of pressure sensors are
response time : 0.1 ms
linearity ( typical : 0.01 %, max .: 0.1 %)

the spectral analysis is realized with ffts in wide or narrow bands . it is possible to choose at any instant of the spectrogram the representation of spectral sections ( frequency / amplitude ) and the lpc spectrum to measure formants .
real time feedback ( eva2 , diana )
maximal phonation time ( eva2 , diana )
results : duration ( maximal phonation time ), mean fundamental frequency , mean spl intensity , mean oral airflow , expired volume during phonation
to measure the vital capacity .
glottal efficiency ( aerodynamic eva2 )
this program allows to evaluate the glottal efficiency , i.e . a ratio between the quantity of acoustic energy and the quantity of aerodynamic energy used for this production .
1 . the subject pronounces a set of " pa pa pa pa pa pa ..." .
2 . during production of / p /, the lips are closed and the glottis is open . an equilibrium of pressures is established in the vocal tract sub - glottic pressure is estimated by measuring the intra - oral pressure .
to study the labials , apico - alveolar and lingo - palatal articulations by displaying the oral airflow , and the velar articulations by displaying the nasal airflow .
method for analysing the nasal resistance during breathing .

i have never been to the centre henry - leonard . if you have anything to contribute , send it on to .
the capacity of the building will also apparently be raised , but i don't have details on how this will be accomplished .
from rte . 138 eastbound : when 138 turns north at boul . lasalle , continue straight through on lasalle instead of turning left .

baie - comeau is isolated a long way from the rest of the league , but the team has made up for it by being famously pugilistic .
the team's two most " local " teams are rimouski and chicoutimi , and the remparts are considered rivals as well , with the four teams now making up a division for the 2008 - 09 season .
