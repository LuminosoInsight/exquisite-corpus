i disagree , if she is 18 then i'd argue that she is the one entering into contract with those other services and since she is developmentally disabled and was unable to understand the ramifications of what she was doing those charges should be voidable . however sprint should allow the person who enters into contract with sprint to disable these third party services from being offered . for a 10,000 bill i'm sure some lawyers will be getting involved with more well through out legal arguments .
to anyone that don't understand what the whole business model behind the iphone is , and why apple are relocking , bricking and being asshats , i'll just repost what i posted in mark's comments : i can’t fathom why they would partner with particular carriers : an iphone open to any network would surely just cream the market . but they have , for whatever market reasons . because they are getting 10 % of at & t’s revenue on data traffic and call minutes . that’s a lot of minutes , a lot of money , and they wouldn’t be getting any if they didn’t give at & t exclusivity . which , incidentally , also is why apple are so totally anal about locking down the iphone , relocking it , and screwing over every buyer with a wish to hack . if they weren’t , at & t would come after them with an army of lawyers and lawsuits . which , incidentally , is also why i think the iphone might be deemed illegal in norway . because , you know , carriers are not allowed to lock down devices for more than 12 months ( technically , they can charge a small fee to permanently unlock an out - of - contract device ). deity , i’m so glad i live in a country where corporations aren’t unilaterally allowed to rape their customers .
the headline was terrible . would you expect me to read the story if the headline had been " cutest cats evar [ pic ]"? of course not . i'm not going to read every article just to see if , despite a title that implies the contrary , there's a good story there .

a guy walks up to a lady in a bar and says " excuse me ma' am , but would you have sex with me for a million dollars ?" the lady looks him up and down and says " well , it would be hard to pass that up . of course ." so the man asks " alright , well would you have sex with me for 1 dollar ?" the woman replies angrily " how insulting ! what kind of a girl do you think i am ?" to which the man says " we've already established that . i was under the impression we were negotiating a price "...
omg , wtf ? so many terrorists ! if i kill a civilian , more terrorists ! wtf ??
i think gore is a middle ground between the outsiders who want change and the insiders that do not . dude , he comes from a political dynasty that spans most of this century , if not longer . he grew up in all this shit , as a child . he's never known any sort of hardship . he's never had to work a real job . he is as far from being an outsider as it is possible to be . he wants change but has been an insider . what change ? he'll open up elections and hurt the dem / repub duopoly ? he'll spend 1 / 5th of our current yearly budget from then on ? root out corruption ? he doesn't want change ... unless it's from you and me . he wants us to change . i think this has been because the dems washed there collective hands of him after 2001 what romantic fantasy are you confusing this with ? i can probably name you one or two democrats who are being ostracized by their party , but he's never been one of them . you've probably not heard of those who have . because now he speaks like i have never heard him speak before . so here you're admitting that charisma counts more than character ? think he may be too popular for the dem king makers to be able to mold him in their images he never had a chance to sell out , he was bought before he was born . and all of them are allowed to play , as long as they move the agenda forward . there's room for him to play around with his pet projects , if he has any . we may get someone who can speak their mind . uh ? i think obama has been keeping his head down thinking he can win an election with honesty no , he made his bid 8 - 12 years too early , and he's trying to figure out what schemes he can get away with to win the nomination . if this is what you think is honesty , there is no helping you . gore on the other hand is highly electable as was proven in 2000 and in an election year when anti republican seems to have reached the levels that anti democrat reached around 2002 - 2003 it would be a nice little land slide that would in and of itself go a long way to healing the nation . healing what ? our impossibly deluded collective self - image ? our beliefs that we can continue spending more than we make , that we can ship off our industry to china , that we can let a private corporation decide how much money to print ?

what's wrong with open source software ? - * i use and do project development with oss . documentation ! i really want to strangle some of these guys ( girls ). 90 % of my time involves trying to decipher what the hell is required to get their crap running . i actually do appreciate the efforts and applaud their passion . the fact is documenting your project isn't hard , personally i find it helps me improve the project . what everyone should include - the most basic instructions needed to get the software up and running . not pages of masturbatory detail that one needs to comb through to find the info you really need - the rest requiring long web searches . i apologize for the rant - it just takes the fun out of using and participating in the oss movement . it also pushes many people away from using oss software .

the person who did the jack nicholson / shining carving is a true artist .
it's attitudes like " i don't feel sorry for her because she chose to make herself an ' easy target '." that imply that the victim is partially at fault , just in a more subtle way . good point , i should choose my words more carefully . as i wrote in another post , my feelings are that it becomes harder to feel sympathy for a girl who makes multiple bad decisions leading up to rapes . i would include " being a prostitute " and " getting drunk with net strangers " on this . i don't see this as thinking she shares the blame , as the blame for the rape lies on the rapist , but at the same time , we should ask women ( and the feminist movement ) to take into account good behavior before hand . let me ask you . if you had a daughter , and you let her go off with a stranger had a gut feeling about in a bad way , to go off to a party , and she got raped , how would you feel ? would you wonder if you could have done anything different to change the outcome ? if you do wonder , would that make you " responsible "? sorry to be so personal , but this is a very sensitive topic . also , it is someones right to not get raped . 100 % it is . an officer of the law should prosecute any and all listed assaults in the post . but rights can be violated , and it is a matter of taking steps to avoid violations .

they are definitely still going after college grads very strongly here at ut ( univ of texas , not that phony univ of tennessee ).
i'm not fan of sen . clinton , but giuliani is still scarier . he's advised by norman podhoretz , who is insistent that we must bomb iran now now now . podhoretz is too extreme even for the bush administration . giuliani also has been competing with the other republican candidates for how loudly he can endorse torture .

even if you think so , is discussion on this wrong ?
yep , and then you realize that you essentially entered into a permanent contract with an expensive prostitute . personally i would never marry a woman that has no ambitions other than to sit on her ass all day watching oprah while hubby slaves away at the office to satisfy her desire to go to the mall with a credit card .
i'm guessing it's higher quality video . speaking from experience , a full video is about 35 minutes in length , and is about 200mb in mpeg - 4 format ( many sites now also offer h . 264 hd or windows media hd clips , which would be larger ). now even if you only watch the video for nine minutes , at 300kb / sec download rate , in those nine minutes you've downloaded about 160mb . let's also say that when logged in , a user will spend 80 % of his / her time streaming porn and 20 % of their time browsing for porn . and of that 20 %, only about 4 % of that consists of information being downloaded ( at the same 300kb / sec ) as the other 16 % is spent navigating a loaded page . so 84 % of a user's given time produces a 300kb / sec load ( no pun intended ) on the server , so call it an average fulltime load of 250kb / sec . and recall that the ad specifies giga - bits not giga - bytes . 3gb / sec is 384mb / sec , which is 393,216kb / sec . divided by an average load of 250kb / sec per user , is 1,572 users downloading simultaneously . that's still a shitload of simultaneous masturbation ...
outstanding post . in the past i have preferred democrats to republicans , but i believe that ron paul is what the country needs in 2008 .
i'm so tired of hearing this issue rehashed over and over by both sides . you know what ? it doesn't matter . even if violence on tv or in a comic book or a novel caused violence in the people that watched / read it 100 % of the time , it wouldn't make a damn bit of difference . being able to tell someone else a story , whatever kind of story you want , is practically an inalienable human right . if you start banning " violent " storytelling , you might as well ban bibles and history books .

what in the hell makes you people think anyone wants to stop it ? exactly . there are enough corporations that are profiting from the war and donating to the campaign funds of both republicans and democrats alike that the only challenge truly facing democrats is the need to appear anti - war to the average american , who has wanted an end to the war for a long time , while rolling over for the white house , claiming a lack of votes or some other lame thing .

a decision to buy apple products if you are a long time windows pc user indicates something important : a change of mind , a trend . don't dwell on the past , look for the potential . apple has a strong , simple product line . strong , because it is renewed once a year and because old products are phased out , simple because there are only around 3 different product of each type ( look at the lineup at dell or creative ). ( simplifies the selection process of the customer ) the latest ipod changes have all brought a higher profit margin to the company . the assembly process has been tweaked the number of components have been reduced .. but not the sticker price : the " starting at 249 " sticker is always in use somewhere . furthermore , apple products have a tendency to stay at the introduction price until the products are replaced by the next generation indicating that profit is stable throughout the entire ( 14 month ) lifetime of a product . aapl is around 185 a share at the moment , the dollar is weak , and the company is going to start selling iphones in europe ( strong euro ) before christmas . granted , the share price might already indicate future sales . ( if jobs has another product hifi presentation .. buy like there is no tomorrow , because prices will take a fall , for a few days ..)

except you know what ? blacks don't want educations !!! who the fuck cares whether or not they get educamations ? they sure as fuck don't ! now ask yourself in that teeny tiny brain of yours why blacks don't want an education . could thug culture have something to do with it ? i sure as hell don't know , but it's a lot more plausible than your " the reason blacks don't want education is because they don't have education " fucking bullshit . for someone who whines that blacks are being depicted as weak - minded easily led sheep , you sure as fuck think they're mindless automatons .

i'm all about ron paul , but i also know how " democracy " in america works . it is a two party system , ron paul is the first candidate i've seen with the ability to throw elections as we know it out of whack . however , if you are a democrat , the last thing you want right now is to demoralize your party . i agree , democrats are weak in that they've constantly giving republicans the ability to step around the rule of law and ignore the constitution , but they don't have a majority in congress . between the filibuster and veto , and the republican's continued heavy partisan " united " front , there is no way in hell that anything would get done if democrats didn't at least ' try ' to work with ' the other party '.

it can view web pages basically the same way they appear on the desktop . your phone can't do that . em , yes it can . the built - in pocket ie has three modes , " one column ", " fit to screen " and " desktop ". alternatively , i could just use the opera browser that i bought which has similar view modes . in the email client , html content is reflowed to fit the screen but if you press a button you get the full width message . also , can your phone play videos and output them to a tv ? it's been able to play video since day one . i had attack of clones playing on it's predecessor in 2002 encoded as divx . the particular phone i have now cannot play it onto the tv . earlier models did that a few years ago but i believe they dropped it as no one was using it . besides , the iphone can't play out onto a tv either . does it have google maps ? yes , it's had that for several years , it came out around the time google maps was getting popular . however , i prefer the others that install the data locally as it's much faster . i have mapopolis and tomtom satnav with gps . this is old old shit . can you choose which voicemail to play first ? no , that's a minor feature . it's nothing compared to the things my phone can do that yours cannot and is not worth downgrading for . can you do a photo slideshow ? are you kidding me ? of course it can . the standard photo software can do basic manipulation and slide shows with all of the standard fade / slide etc effects . you can also do a show of all the videos you have recorded . there is a third - party art package available that uses the stylus to very good effect , it's quite a usable graphics tablet apparently . seriously , everything the iphone can do has been done better already . that's why so many people dislike it .
i was thinking the same thing . crimes like theft at least have some logical basis ( i want money , someone else has money , i will take that money ). an act like this is pure malice and shows a contempt for everything civilized society stands for . throw away the key .
no , they should still try to fix as much as they can , however , you're still screwed .
not hot enough to melt it , apparently
if you read further into the article , you'd see this doesn't contradict what it's trying to say . if you don't know what you're doing and need to hack together some experiments in code to see what works well and what doesn't , then do that . just don't clutter up your main project with your experiments , and make sure your end solution integrates well with the rest of the code . i suppose i should also mention that there are many other useful types of formal models other than actual code . for example , diagrams that show the major subsystems of an application and how they interact are a type of formal model for the application as a whole . so are pseudocode and mathematical descriptions of algorithms . don't be fooled into thinking code is the only useful type of formal model .
you are spot on , except for a few clarifications : 1 ) is god really a " building ?" our only two options logically , as far as i am aware , are that the universe either came into being or that it always has been . the first option , which seems to be the dominant view right now , lends itself to the questions " where did it come from ? how did it start ? what was there before the universe ?" science can have an origination , but that requires scientists to accept that they may not be able to understand the universe completely . 2 ) belief in god for many people results in proceeding from conclusions to observations , but it doesn't have to . is it wrong to see evolution as god's creation ? is it wrong to appreciate the universe as divinely created or managed ? who cares if someone believes that evolution was " guided " by god through the natural laws we have deduced ? intelligent design is different than that , obviously , because it assumes god made some of the choices along the way , but if someone believes that god created natural law and evolution is a product of that , is that wrong ?
joe dimaggio did it on coffee and cigarettes .
sounds like a great hoax
how does that imply anything ?
i agree with you , almost . the over sexualization of breasts is what has caused the maternal perception to be overridden . in american society , breasts have become little more than eye candy . they have been relegated to something to be lusted after . this doesn't have anything to do with religion , but rather the way that women are objectified in the media . you can go to a catholic mass in latin america and see women with their breasts out feeding their children . breasts still serve their original purpose there . yes they are still seen as sexual objects , but the maternal purpose overrides the the sexual perception . america is just goofy .

it depends on local law , but you'd be surprised -- contrary to what most people think , in most jurisdictions that descend from the english common law ( the uk , australia , canada , most us states ), there is no duty in the criminal law to intervene to stop a criminal assault , even things as extreme as rape and murder . ( you may be liable in tort , but not in criminal law -- and the dog is not capable of being a plaintiff in a tort action .) not intervening makes you a terrible person , of course , but it's not a criminal offense . note that once you move towards actively participating or encouraging the crime , the situation changes . you can watch a rape at a pool hall , but you can't egg the rapist on ( this was one of the cases we covered in first - year criminal law ).
but how do we decide who has the best chance of winning ? oh , right . the media decides for us . sigh ...
yes -- that's his point . he works with functional languages , and while in a fpl you can build everything from simple blocks ( for example , you teach car , cdr , cons , etc , and soon the student " gets " it , and is able to write programs ). but in a gui - building language things are sort of large and messy ( and hey , i'm comparing this to common lisp !!!)

well ... it should . hopefully one day the people will be able to actually vote ( in an election that isn't rigged ) on whether they want pot to be legal . kinda like in a democracy . it's sad how far fetched that idea seems .
how i would word it depends on which question i was asking -- they're mixing two . i would , perhaps , ask it in two parts --" a ) do you believe iran is building nuclear weapons ? b ) would you support a military strike to stop this ?" or just ask one question , without the manipulative assumptions : " if you believed iran was creating nuclear weapons , would you support a first strike against the program ?"
because then you're limited to your ide's widgets .

but i wonder if she mentioned the 5 languages thing at all . from the way she put it , she only noticed that he became quiet after talking to marco . you must have missed it , but before , i wrote i didn't get the impression that she told her date that she speaks 5 languages i think speaking italian while with non - italian speakers , when there are other languages that can be used is rude , no matter how it comes up . i am assuming , of course , that the date did not speak italian and that marco speaks english , which i think are both reasonable . i brought up the 5 languages thing to illustrate that she was showing off to us , in that article . she might as well have written , " i struck up conversation with the owner ( marco ) in italian - and by the way i'm awesome ." a date that's a competition : stupid . " alphas " and " betas ": even stupider . agreed .
last year i remember being out shopping on november 1st and being shocked that all the stores were rolling out their christmas stock with halloween just a few hours past . this year it seems they're skipping halloween and going right to christmas , a full two weeks earlier than last year . i guess we know which holiday is more profitable . i rebel by putting off all of my christmas shopping until december 24th . at least , i tell myself it's rebellion , and not procrastination .
just like at kent state ?
the part you're leaving out in you wife's story though is that family involvement is a lot higher in mexico as well . many parties are attended by people of all ages , so you don't typically see congregations of teens will large volumes of alcohol in the same place and alone . as much as i think the legal age should be lowered ( to like 16 ), i think that its hard to draw parallels with other cultures on the effect it will have on the us .

the laws set forth in five books of moses which includes deuteronomy is also known as the torah . the torah is very fundamental to judaism . however , depending on which christian denomination you are talking about the torah has less influence . many consider the teachings of christ , the new testament , as partially or completely replacing the old law .

put it underneath the headline in a smaller font and different color .
he's one of the few potential presidential candidates who appears to be honest about his political ideology and who is willing to discuss it in something other than cute sound - bites . unfortunately , he's also a free - market fundamentalist , who has confused laissez - faire capitalism with personal liberty , and who would like to implement the same " market reforms " that wrecked indochina , russia , and many other nations recently . he's also anti - abortion and appears to have no interest in environmental issues . on the other hand , he opposes the patriot act and gun - boat diplomacy .
doesn't matter , he stays in moms basement . only people he ever sees are at the wow convention .
because the liberal people are smarter and take all the good jobs .
garfield ? is that you ?
pretty neat bit of history . imagine the story behind the sword ...
can we impeach pelosi too ?
wtf is wrong with yahoo ?
though i enjoy disparaging american men as pedophiles , i don't think it explains the disappearance of pubic hair in american culture . i think a better explanation is americans ' fear of healthy sexuality and their totalitarian instincts . both of which manifest as obsessions with " hygiene ". in fact , to the extent that americans have pedophilic instincts , i would explain those in terms of their totalitarian instincts . it is after all easier to control and break down a child .
actually , i appreciate it . that wasn't a typo , i was just wrong . fixed .
yeah , well good luck getting an apology out of them .
dood , your making the rest of us war profiteers look bad .
that's pretty much directly contrary to the implication of the article . the mythical " sufficiently smart compiler " is one that does tricky jobs such as parallelising code without hints from the programmer . however , the required information can be mandated by the language , and the smart compiler isn't needed . the article gets across reasonably well that various language - design decisions were made to take away ambiguity that might fool the compiler .
they become annoyed hasn't happened yet . very telling . hold on . someone's going by my cubicle .... edit : where was i ? how could some lose those ten voters if they never knew he existed in the first place ? then again , hanging chads ...
it looks like a gumdrop .
i'm willing to listen to criticism of israel , but i've got a hard time taking any site seriously which , with a straight face , warns us of the machinations of the illuminati .
well it seems the soda can was what made him go over the edge , when the suv is the bigger polluter .
it's not america butting it's nose in - there is pressure on the us to recognise the genocide , it's not the us pressuring others . there's pressure on the us from turkey not to officially recognise it ( although many states already do ). but let's make a comparison here - holocaust deniers are crazy . it happened . there's not as much evidence concerning the genocide of armenians , but there is enough by far . denying it is almost as crazy , and wrong .
oh , i get it .. it's like watching tom cruise play tom cruise playing a role ?
the southern us needs to grow . the . fuck . up .
sqlrelay using a pre - fork model while dbslayer is threaded which for high traffic sites makes a performance difference . this also forces users into a stateless model ( ie don't mess then the connection attributes , or run transactions accross multiple requests ), which might feel uncomfortable at first but we believe is a better model . http reduces the client side burden since no specialized libs are required .
agreed . the huge difference in canada , i think , is that the black people living here chose to be here , mostly ; they aren't largely the descendants of people who were enslaved and brought to this country against their will . yet i have black friends here in canada -- mostly of caribbean descent -- who have confronted plenty of overt and / or subtle racism in the " true north strong and free ". no nation is exempt from irrational hatred on the part of its most ignorant and ill - educated citizens , in my view . canada included , i'm sad to say . as for me : i'm canadian seven generations back on both sides , but happened to be born on a caribbean island where whites were a small minority . so i learned tolerance and acceptance very early in my life . but not all canadians are like me .
he was correct to warn us about the growing military - industrial complex , but he did so in his departing speech . his actions did nothing but contribute to the problem , then in his departing speech , he pays only lip service to the issue .
they had a ban on interracial dating until 2000 , ban wikipedia access from the dorms ( someone must have searched " vagina " once , require chaperones to go on a date ...
wtf ?! freeing enslaved human beings made conditions worse , so according to you those darkies were better off and happy being beaten raped and worked to death , well i guess stopping ww2 caused more anti - semitism too right . no , black slave owners weren't racist they were pieces of shit who thought owning another human was ok .( also many wealth free blacks that did own slaves did so to get them away from brutal white slave owners , they were treated humanely and allowed to work for their freedom and a bit of land ) but don't tell us that white slave owners weren't racist that has got to be one of the most ridiculous things i've read in a while .
let's not forget that a . q . khan , the director of pakistan's nuclear project spent two decades giving instructions and materials on how to build nuclear weapons to whoever wanted it . ( aside : he offered to sell information to iran in the late 1980s , but iran declined to take him up .) after he admitted to his long run as a weapons proliferator in 2004 , staunch us ally pervez musharraf ordered him to write a letter of apology and then granted him a full pardon , with hugs all around . the war on terror is bullshit .
united states is the land of hero worship . everyone wants to be superman , americans just convinced themselves that they will be , and so they structure society accordingly .
you need fp to draw a line ? ah , it's an . edu domain . what was i expecting ?
there's no visible plane in that video . it's pretty suspicious that the pentagon refused to release video that shows a plane .

downmodded again . why am i not surprised ? because reddit is 99 % white people who have never , ever had to think about race in any sort of meaningful way in their entire life . " hey , i " m not racist , it doesn't bother me , so the problem doesn't exist !"
and yet paul is [...] likely to advance the cause of restricting rights - like eroding the right to privacy citation needed . abortion rights at a national level . certain states have severely restricted access to abortion and abortificats ; if others wish to go that way , these states have already beat the path . the horror story of women needing to cross state lines to get an abortion is ... pretty much the reality . at least a better economy will make it more affordable for them to travel ; at least free trade will make it easier for them to acquire abortificants . why support him for his pie - in - the - sky ideas when his more realistic ones would be immediately harmful ? for a start , you've reversed my consideration of which ideas are pie - in - the - sky and which are immediately helpful .
you're saying that an atheist only actively disbelieves the gods he knows about . for example if you never heard of the god kali ( until i just mentioned it now ) they wouldn't have known their stance on him . now with uttering his name , the disbelief comes forward . an atheist can , i think , have a lack of belief without active disbelief in a god he has heard of . i can't disprove russel's teapot , and thus , i don't disbelieve in it . i don't believe in it either , though , because i have no good reason to . same goes for the flying spaghetti monster , the invisible pink unicorn , and others . i don't think this makes me any less of an atheist . only an agnostic can know of the existence of a possible god and remain undecided on its validity . agnosticism is a proclaimed lack of knowledge of the existence or non - existence of gods . knowledge is separate from belief , and an agnostic person can thus be an atheist , or even a theist .
he looks so cute though :) 3
yeah -- we could go down fighting , instead ! death to women !
actually , 0.999 ... is in some ways more correct than " 1 ". for things like cantor's diagonal argument , you need every number to have a single representation . you can have 1 , or 1.0 , or 1.000 , but 0.999 ... is an infinite decimal expansion that cannot be collapsed ( unlike 1.000 ...), so it's an easy way to get unique and consistent representations for all terminating decimal sequences .
my uncle had this syndrome ... unfortunately he used to shave himself with a sharp knife ... he has gone now
well we do owe the chinese something like ten billion in junk us government bonds . hopefully this will make them less likely to collect .
true , but that's the point ; the more difficult it is for you to make a choice , the more influence your subconscious should have over your decision .
you must not have read a lot about ben stein recently . i'd say you should search the archives for his name , but that feature's not working at present . suffice to say that ben stein's ideology is republicanism of the nixon / reagan variety . he worships at the altar so much that this feels more like apostasy in the name of friendship rather than a heartfelt belief that democrats aren't evil .
yeah , reminds me of the guy who shot himself in a session at city hall over a zoning issue .
and they're the ones with decent grammar , aren't they ? :)
i bet the bush administration is the first administration to ever do anything like this ! not at all , the administrations of the soviet union used to do it all the time .
international federation of the phonographic industry did anyone else read this as " international federation of the pornographic industry "?
it's very easy to say " i'd open one a week " or " the cost benefit analysis says i'd open x amount of boxes ", but faced with actual death for opening a box , i highly doubt anyone economically capable of sitting in a comfy chair , posting on reddit from a warm dwelling even approaches the boxes , let alone starts opening them .
they're turning kids into slaves just to make cheaper sneakers but what's the real cost ' cause the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper why are we still paying so much for sneakers when you got them made by little slave kids ? what are your overheads ?!
once again , taken out of context . of course a doctor , paramedic , fireman , teacher , or , as you say , miner deserves more respect ; their actions contribute to the betterment of the pubic ( not sure about the miner ... we do need copper ... so , uh , right ). no one is saying society benefits from wwe wresters . please take your self - congratulatory opinion elsewhere .
she's going to expose a great deal of corruption . the people she accuses will be punished and the world is going to be a better place . that's exactly how it's going to happen .
so , we all view reddit.com as a monolith , no ?
modded up for satire , intentional or not . also , you don't need ron paul to bork your election this year . the gop clusterfuck brigade can do that on their own .
you think those are real pixels you're using ?
well i started over to re - design a couple of weeks ago , i'll have some usable interface going on in another couple of weeks i'd guess . problem is my code generally sucks and although it works and you'd be simply amazed at some of the apps i've made , behind the scenes it's messy inefficient code : d that's me , haha .
war is peace .
i just tried to post this article only to ask this question . is this even anatomically possible the answer is , no way . also noticed that cnn left the " red eye " in the picture they used of her .
if her husband wasn't a past president she wouldn't be running for the presidency . i agree she is just a pawn she sold out a long time ago .

this is not justice , it's a criminal act , probably carried out by organized criminals looking to " acquire " his business . this is a common occurrence within any black market , which is why you see so much crime associated with prohibited drugs . unfortunately , unlike with drugs , gambling and prostitution , there exists no easy solution of simply " legalizing it ", as the act of infecting people's computers for profit is an actual criminal act which harms victims . however , it stands as a good example of why any non - violent criminal activity involving money will likely lead to subsequent violent criminal activity . to me , that means we need to avoid creating environments of crime by not prohibiting undesirable activities that can be dealt with in more productive ways ( drug abuse , gambling addiction , etc ...).
and yet you've taken the time to click the link and post a comment .

tomorrow's headline : judge facciola suddenly resigns from bench for health reasons and to spend more time with his family .
the funny thing is ... most of the time , when a web site is hacked , it's done to make the owner of the site look crazy , foolish , or stupid . this might be the first time in history that a site was hacked in order to make it sound rational , sane , and pleasant .
this reminded me of a story i read a few years back about mormon sxe kids in salt lake city pulling this same kind of crap . beating up people for smoking a cigarette in public and jumping people coming out of liquor stores . i tried to find the story on the internets but no luck . it's interesting that you can call yourself a christian and do things like this routinely and call yourself a good person just because you don't smoke / drink / do drugs .
uh , this mass transit is run just like any other mass transit . you have not ridden ( experienced is a better word ) septa have you ... / septa rider

actually this comment has kinda opened my eyes . i'm currently 25 and enjoying a good salary ( with 3 years of experience ). when 40 comes i'd have 18 years of experience . finding a job with that much experience will be damn difficult ( expensive for companies )... mmmm ... what should i be doing now ..
no . i take no bias against older or younger programmers .
would you get your news from a tv station with a " fark it " button on all their stories ? journalistic integrity ain't what it used to be ...
because it's broken . the recommended page has completely failed me . of course , i'm providing almost all negative things . that shouldn't be an issue though , if they coded it right .
i can't think of many serious calibre handguns or rifles designed specifically for target shooting , however i don't doubt there are , hence the exception . conversely i could list hundreds of firearms designed with the specific purpose of delivering maximum lethality , and tens of thousands of variants .
who said the purpose was for preventing or solving crime ?
in the nineteen - twenties , even . i was wondering whether he still felt so smug eight years later , in the great depression ...
amy poehler is awesome . which reminds me , i need to get the upright citizen's brigade season 2 dvd now that it's out .
americans united for the separation of church and state is a good group , as is the freedom from religion foundation . i prefer the first because its less about atheism . seems like they should build a coalition of those who want religion to remain private and reduce its influence in the public sphere -- that way you pull - in folks who are not pure materialists but not bible - thumpers either .
my team worked really , really , really hard to keep the site up and there was a lot of traffic on the site [ on 9 / 11 ]. we'll never know the numbers , because we had to turn off the clock to save processor cycles . turn off the clock ?
thanks a million ! i thought that 25 ! was a huge number , so a million ! must be unbelievably huge .
i don't know why , but the type of punchline that ends hope they blah in blah always tickles me . probably shouldn't admit that .
yeah , drink a real beer . like fosters , molson's , or stella artois .
the article simply misspells don de bats , who appears to be a real professor of american studies at flinders . i'm inclined to believe this is a true story after all , and some guy on a blog is pretending it's fake .
i think when we have a programming language using only whitespace is where we've gone too far . lolcode is just fucking brilliant i agree .

i wonder if all this rails bashing is going to actually increase rails usage ? i suspect it will . if the instigators have as little credibility as this guy , you're probably right in your guess . he's basically james mcgovern 2.0 , yet another self - proclaimed thought leader .
i used to go to ubc and work in a restaurant near by that the ubc rcmp used to frequent . ubc is where the rcmp sends cops from other areas who misbehave ( think showing up for a shift drunk not tazering an innocent kid ). it's pretty much a frat house . anyway , there used to be a group of four of them that would come by the restaurant after their shift . they'd hit the siren a couple times in the back lot and we'd have a bucket of corona on a table and a few dozen wings in the fryer .
you're right , but just to be clear : " salt hash ", where hash is a single iteration of md5 or sha1 , is so fast as to be almost ineffective for typical user passwords . it's not a nit ; if you're storing simple sha1 hashes of passwords , your application is insecure .
i love the cameo appearance of the monopoly dog .

i wish it was instead : " young people rejecting christianity , have perception of religion as irrational and harmful " or put it more succinctly , " young people rejecting christianity , have perception of religion as being bullshit ."
sometimes ? no , freedom is doing what you are told . what we don't see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want , be anything they can be . freedom is about authority . giuliani 2008 .
no , by the end of her life , she pretty much was committable . she'd go on talk shows and talk about how the audience was conspiring against her . i think the only reason she was left on her own was that she was any freaking rand . but even then ... in my semi - educated opinion , atlas shrugged was not the work of an entirely sane mind . especially when compared to the relatively erudite fountainhead . it reads in general like it was written by a paranoid delusional , but it's really the amount of hate in the book that sets it apart . i'm amazed that anyone can read the scene with the trainwreck and not get chills of the bad kind . she literally goes car by car and explains why everyone on it deserves to die ... including the children . the only other time i've seen something like that in supposedly serious literature was in the left behind series . and it's a shame since i think that the fountainhead , for its flaws , is really a great work of humanistic literature .
this is from the same set of species that thought " dharma and greg " would be a smash hit , or that there was nothing wrong with " kid nation ". i highly suspect their approach is to throw as much shit at the wall as possible , and see what sticks .

commodity backed currency but you have a problem with these terms . the federal reserve produces no commodities to back its currency with . to get this to the bare bones , let's say i make a loaf of bread worth 1 . when the fed finds out , they conclude the economy has grown , and issue a brand new 1 bill . how can they back their currency with my loaf of bread ?

yes , all scientists recognize that radiocarbon dating is only good for 60,000 years or so . thats why dinosaur paleontologists use potassium / argon and argon / argon dating instead , which is good for several billion years at least . additionally , studying fission tracks in zircon crystals ( damage done to the zircon crystal lattice by radioactive uranium ). to answer some folk's questions about whats happened since march 05 , the north carolina researchers have been able to sequence a few proteins and a short nucleotide sequence . but we're talking about something infinitesimal like 0.00001 % of the entire dna strand . we also know this individual had medullary bone , a tissue that only female birds develop in their marrow cavity , in order to store up extra calcium for laying eggs during breeding season . so , we know it was a ' she ' and that she died during breeding season . and , as someone above noted , it does strengthen the evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds .

does britain really have a ' sky - high ' crime rate ? table 1 from that for homicides at least , britain is much better than a lot of countries .
vlasic is a brand of pickles , seems like you havent heard of it though .
historically , many of the early drug laws were motivated much more by racism than classism . hence a big crack - down on smoking opium in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , since it was associated mainly with chinese immigrants . similarly , the first regulation and subsequent prohibitions for cocaine and marijuana were both motivated , at least partly , by fear of blacks , who supposedly would get violent and hurt southern whites while high ( which wasn't actuually happening ). it's a straw man argument to say that a racist would applaud gang wars and ignore drug problems that affect mainly blacks . racism is a complicated thing , a big part of which is ( exaggerated ) fear of other groups . fear of black gang violence , and racist attitudes among whites , certainly played a part in the current drug law regime . you assume that urban blacks who aren't drug dealers or gang members applaud the enormous drug sentences for crack ; i don't think that's the case . enforcement and crime reduction is not the same thing as harsh sentencing ; putting a user ( not dealer ) in prison for years is usually not in the best interest of urban communities .
no offense but i hope your lack of primary research isn't reflective of nyu's journalism program these days . many of these questions could be answered from blog postings , google , already published articles , etc .
some states do it already . so now your saying that some peoples votes shouldn't count ??
this is just the beginning . i'm hoping that those who support the neo - cons wake up after their leaders are in prison . of course we may need to invade paraguay to get bush .
having the biggest bookmakers in the world say paul has , conservatively , a close to 10 % chance of being the next president is pretty significant and shows how much of a frontrunner ron paul is .

that's what the up - arrow is for .
thank you for sharing such an insightful rebuttal .
the thing that bothers me about sending my money to a country with a very low standard of living is that i am , little by little , importing that standard of living here . cocoa doesn't grow well in canada , so maybe i'm not digging a grave with my chocolate - buying habits , but perhaps i am indirectly . an industry in a country with no unions or social programs can compete easily against one that does , particularly if only moderate skill is required . to compete with that , we have to come up with industries where our social programs make us competitive , or can't be exported . hence the importance of engineers and mcjobs . will it be enough ? or does the government have to give companies more and more tax breaks , pushing the burden further and further down the food chain until it all breaks . so i try to send my money to countries that have the same social structures ( if local isn't competitive ), such as europe , or to fair trade co - operatives . i'm hoping the short - term pain prevents long - term pain .
just re - click the vote you've already made . it will vanish .
thanks for increasing the programming reddit's signal to noise ratio .
clearly they did , seeing as they programmed the " achievement " into the game .
i thought it was referential transparency , which you can still have with any strict language , even c . not quite . with referentially transparency , const 5 5 but in a strict language , by definition , const 5 the important point of haskell is not that it's lazy \[ 1 \], but that it's non - strict . \[ 1 \] in fact , as far as the language is concerned , laziness is an implementation detail : it's perfectly ok to implement haskell non - lazily ( see eager haskell ), as long as you stay non - strict .

no sign of the original story anywhere in hebrew or in english . nor are there is even one mention on the hebrew forums or blogs , which is very strange if this came out last month . there would have been an explosion of reactions because elizur and karpel are public figures . i'd say the posters have to authenticate the original .
