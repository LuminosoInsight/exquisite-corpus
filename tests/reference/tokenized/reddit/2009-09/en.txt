it wouldn't be about biden . it would be about pissing off the majority of the country / world and turning them against people like beck and limbaugh for a very long time .
after all that , they should have peach say " fine , i'll fucking blow you ."
my mom was re - married for several years before i found out . we went to a restaurant . she paid with a credit card , and was asked for a driver's license . i noticed that her last name was different on the license .
i used to sell cigarettes at a supermarket in new jersey , and i don't know if it was a law but the state government gave us literature telling us we had to check ids for anyone who appeared to be under the age of 26 . it could have been a recommendation and not actually criminal , though . i don't know .
i've already immediately dumped every insurance company , and will not ever pay a private health insurance company for any reason , even if legally required to , even if it's taken out of my taxes ( i'll become a tax cheat if it comes to that ). and yes , i would switch to the public option if available .
on horseback . it's very impressive .
easy play is never a reward . it's less a game and more an activity at that point . i like activities a lot ( harvest moon is one of my favorite game series ), but those activities i like are not simply overseeing fights and clicking basically inconsequential dialogue options . i want challenge . if a game is challenging to lots of other people , that's awesome , they can love it all they like . but if it's not challenging to me , i don't re - imagine my experience as better simply because others are challenged . that's why i respect the creators and the creation , but note that it was not for me . you can make plenty of challenge without any grind . in fact , it's ease that often leads to the feeling of a grind because the same low level of challenge is always present , so game progress is caused mostly by time spent . the tiresome first planet was the biggest red flag . but it continued after that for me . it's really rare to find a game that is tolerable for hours and suddenly gets awesome . it was tolerable and simply remained tolerable .
don't downvote this guy . it's a best of , but i hear that a lot of workplaces block craigslist .

is limbaugh still on the air ? i thought glenn beck took over for him . at any rate , i'd love to have the skills to read minds and know what other people believe like he does . its interesting to note that our last republican president never worked a day in his life and basically was a total slacker and only got anywhere by trading on his name . our last two democratic presidents came from very humble beginnings and basically pulled themselves up by their bootstraps .
ooh , i can sort of one - up that . surprisingly , the following did not get me fired . i worked at game crazy , and my boss was a complete asshat . he accused everyone of stealing ( and of course was later found to be stealing ) and was just the kind of guy you wish you could slap with a rubber glove that's been smeared in a dirty toilet . so i didn't meet mvp / pre - order quotas that week , and got to clean hollywood video's bathroom as an impromptu punishment . the smug , proud way in which he told me to get to it was all i needed ... a few minutes later , my wish came true , i slapped that guy in the face with a dirtied rubber glove . his reaction ? " gross dude , cut it out ". seriously . me and my friends / coworkers all quit on him within the same month because we were all accused of stealing . i got two friends and an awesome story out of that job , so i don't regret a thing !

don't go crazy with the tensioning bolt . i recommend leaving it alone until you really feel it getting uncomfortably soft , and then only tensioning it in tiny increments . don't go crazy with the oils and nonsense . you'll just make the leather too soft , causing it to stretch out too much . cover it if it's going to get wet . the official brooks covers are crappy and they say " brooks " on them , which isn't really what you want to advertise when your bike is locked up on a pole . i got a really nice waterproof , stretchy , black one from my bike shop for 12 . if you do get it wet , let it dry out before riding it . greatest saddles ever made . oh and although i also call them saddles , i've never understood what the big deal with calling it a seat is . when i call it a seat and some fancy - pants says , " oh you mean the saddle ," i just say , " yeah , you know the thing connected to the saddle post that goes into the saddle tube , asshole ."
the statute of limitations is for bringing charges , and charges have already been brought . moreover , periods spent as a fugitive in a foreign country would not count toward the statute .
if it's in a cap , pressed ... it's not pure mdma . you can't say this . you can say in general , pressed pills tend to include adulterants . pure mdma is composed of brown crystals . or white crystals , or slightly grey crystals . brown crystals to me mean a lazy synth , but it's not like it's going to kill you . how is the high different from e ? what is " e "? e to me means mdma , so they'd be the same . if you're asking if the high is different than adulterated pills , since you don't know the adulterants , this question is impossible . is 50 a half gram a good price ? it's not great , but whatever . how can i be sure it's not cut with something ? you can't unless you do a test with a marquis reagent , or you do a solvent wash . the hype about mdma crystals as always pure is of course total bullshit , and mdma powder is almost always cut . the nice thing is that the cuts tend to be rather inactive or mild ( bulking agents , largely inactive cuts ) rather than the adulterants in pills ( active cuts ). but honestly , the real difference is : 1 . pills tends to be total and absolute shit these days . 2 . mdma crystals tend to be mostly mdma with a few cuts , which beats the hell out of # 1 . just don't lie to yourself and pretend it's pure like all the other idiots .

this is nothing new . the cs dept at my university was part of the msdn academic alliance and i basically had free access to pretty much every single piece of software than m sold when i was in school . in fact at one point demand became so high that the school just ripped off all the cds / dvds and hosted the isos on a ftp server . you just had to login with your school username / password to download all the isos at one shot .

there are some breeding organizations with much stricter standards than the kennel club and actually do quite a bit of work into researching both breeding dogs ' family histories to avoid excessive inbreeding , avoid genetic problems , and continue to create excellent specimens of desired breeds ...
or you could just do what i did . i paid 180 for my first guitar and then around 50 for a cheap amp . a lot of people are either lazy or tone deaf . there's no need to buy such expensive equipment just to experiment with learning a musical instrument . please don't think that i'm advising against learning an instrument . i'm just trying to provide a perspective for starting small .

i was trying to figure out how to get 15 people to come to my house and let me film them for months at a time , occasionally intervening to offer them measly scraps of food or the power to save the life of a fellow house mate , and now i know , i just have to buy a house in turkey .

no , he didn't make a living as a writer . he committed suicide and his novels were published more than a decade after his death . a confederacy of dunces got a pulitzer price . your logic seems to be implying that a writer needs to be bought to be a writer . one just needs to write , really . published professionals are their own category .
oops i posted 10 seconds early for the creepiest part , thanks . well after watching that a few times i feel indoctrinated . how about you ? if you'll excuse me i'm going to go join obama's youth now ; i hear they're handing out nifty uniforms with arm bands . / s
another ex - junkie chiming in here . there are a surprising number of us aren't there ? the one thing that we have in common is that we all seem to be white collar junkies , that is we all held down jobs ( or went to school ) while supporting our habit . i would love to find some sort of support group meeting for people like us . i am not going to say that i am better than the junkie who is homeless and doesn't work , but when you go to na meetings the type of people there are ones who i can't relate to at all . we should start some sort of reddit aa for programmer / nerd junkies .
right on steve .
if by a few people you mean all 30,000 people who go to my school , anybody who lives within a mile or so of me , anybody who uses the airport , anybody who goes to baseball games , anybody who uses public transportation to get around , then yes ... just some shit for a few people

according to their website activewave tags are active rfid tags which means they use batteries . they also appear to be trackable from great distances . discharge the battery or replace it with a dead cell ? they also appear to have a tamper alarm so if you're going to open it up , don't do it on campus where the thing can call home .

adult swim is more of it's own channel anyway . it's not like kids watch cartoons until 4 in the morning anyway . agreed , it's like renting out the daycare at night for midget wrestling , but who watches midget wrestling in the middle of the day ? i'm getting off topic . you should be more upset about the live action kid shows they're trying to play in the afternoon . see link : like adult swim , and welcome the british office series on the lineup . it has really great and funny shows that fit in with each other with similar humor that would not get stand alone time anywhere else .

when i saw this title , i couldn't believe my eyes . i read it and read it again to make sure it wasn't just another devious ideology - pushing , narrow - minded shuckster , of which we have so many now , trying to trick me into clicking something i don't give a damn about and garnering an inevitable downvote . this title fully explained what could be found in the article , and it did so with zest . with panache . it added value , rather than grudgingly spacing out a required field . my downtrodden spirit soared for a moment as i believed , for just a second , that the old guard had returned , and that this modern - age library of alexandria had once more opened its doors in its original purpose . every time i see this headline on my front page , it makes me laugh and reminisce . it's like an old friend to whom you've said your final goodbye to coming back for just one last visit .

if someone has broken into my own home , they are already on thin ice . if they give me the chance to do so , they will be told to leave and warned that i will shoot . if they are advancing against warnings to stop , or overtly threatening harm on me / mine , they will be shot . if they continue , they will be shot some more . when they stop attacking , i stop defending . they can either lie down and wait for the cops and ambulance , or they can keep attacking and leave in a bag . an important thing about self defense is that you have to know what your limits are ahead of time . there is no time to debate and decide once you are in the thick of it . edit : i just noticed the mention of " comfortable " here again , so i'll reply again ... accepting the facts of a situation , and doing what you need to do , has nothing to do with being comfortable with it . it's not comfortable , but sometimes it's necessary .

he cheats a little on that one . for example , he uses " up - to - the - minute " on page 75 . it's not used as a phrase , the hyphens appear to be thrown in to prevent the word " the " from being reused . he has several other examples just like this throughout . the problem is , " the " is a word , even if it is used as part of a phrase . therefore , " the " is a word repeatedly used throughout the novel .

the free market isn't evil , as long as it has a leash and receives punishment whenever it bites someone and sends them to the hospital . you think anyone who isn't a right - libertarian doesn't believe in the free market ? no , i just think the kind of market that you advocate is feral . ah . it just occurred to me how you will likely reply to this , so allow me to preempt it : " no , i don't like the way it works now , i think it's far from ideal ."
yeah , that's a pretty story . and it certainly teaches the right lesson about avoiding these kind of hopeless " in - love - before - we've - ever - gone - on - a - date " after school special crushes and that we need to be forthright with our feelings before we have too much invested in them to go back . but when you sit down and think -- or , god forbid , talk with your crush -- about it , trying to turn a best friend into a so is kind of a scary proposition , isn't it ? what was worse , the story above where the narrator had a lifelong best friend who loved him , or this one ( below )? and how much more likely is it than the other story , the one where the 10th grade best friends date , are sexually compatible , can cohabit peacefully , and live happily ever after ? 10th grade as i sat there in english class , i stared at the girl next to me . she was my so called " best friend ". i stared at her long , silky hair , and wished she was mine . but she didn't notice me like that , and i knew it . after class , she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before and handed them to her . she said " thanks " and gave me a kiss on the cheek . i asked her out . she said yes . 10th grade , 3 months later we were better off friends . all she does is complain , and she won't let me touch her boobs . i'm breaking up with her . the end edit : formatting

i was hammered at a party at someone's house where the parents were out of town . i found a straight blade shaver , and proceeded to hack off locks of people's hair with it . ( not cool # 1 ). after more and more shots , i blacked out . i woke up in the morning and opened one eye . i saw some strange family eating breakfast . i closed my eye and went back to sleep , some weird dream or something . i can smell and hear bacon cooking . i open my eyes again , and the family is still there eating breakfast ; mother in robe cooking , father in dress cloths , son and daughter eating .. i look down and i am buried in a pile of laundry on a couch . i meekly say " hello ?" and the mother screams , and they all freak out . i say " i have no idea where i am ". the father calms his family and states that he has heard of this before . holy shit , i woke up inside some random persons house !! i walked outside to see my car , and that i was 10 miles from the party ( not cool # 2 ) and in the neighborhood of my girlfriend . they called the cops , just as a precaution . i explained my side and the cops took a report , but let me go after a while . so after all the drama i caused , i get in my car and right as i sit down on , i feel something in my back pocket . it was the straight edge razor !! ( not cool # 3 ) summary : i blacked out , drove 10 miles , sleepwalked into some random family's house , curled up on their couch and used their laundry as a cover , all with a straight edge razor in my back pocket . i should have been shot , or arrested , but go away clean . no believed me , but shit , it was scarily true .

most theists have a difficulty with objective critical thinking i don't know that i'd say that . i've seen some very strong objective critical thinking from the theistic side . the difference is the where the basis of truth comes from . we generally take natural reality to be the basis , and work from there . they tend to take the bible and / or their communication with god , and work from there .

there is a key difference that i didn't extrapolate : the russian in the for instance example was only asking for rememberence for the 400 killed and 1200 injured in the beslan school attack ... not using that to propel their hate or distrust for the geogian people . if someone was talking about 9 / 11 and the " americans " killed by " freedom hating terrorists " that deserves the response that the op linked . that person is obviously out of contact with reality and being reminded that the us , for all of it's goods , is nowhere close to the example all other nations should live by . simply remembering a tragic event in which the unaccountable and innocent were killed in the name of their government , religion , race is not the same as politicizing and propelling a self - interest or simply " intellectual chest booming " over said event ( s ).
i think your response is spot - on ; as hornetjockey points out , informative , respectful , and accurate . i also like that you start with material on einstein's pantheistic religious views ( with citations ), and then move to snopes . it grounds the material more firmly : einstein's actual beliefs , noting that einstein's beliefs are often mischaracterized , intentionally or otherwise , and finally the refutation of this particular bit of micharacterization .
i agree that net profit is what really matters . i was using revenue to illustrate the point that an individual would have a difficult time bringing in that amount of cash no matter what kind of margins they were capable of .
thank - fucking - god someone said it at last ! i'd just about had it with most redditors that justified hondura's military coup with that line : but he violated the constitution ! get some reality into your life people . the us is an empire , and all of our little central american nations are just more of its territory . they own us . and these " constitutions " you all hail to be so good to us , are really pieces of shit shackles that impede us from prospering . they take away the people's rights to change what's bothering us . so god forbid a president ( elected by the majority no less ) decides that stupid piece of paper written by the elite is going to be changed in order to benefit the majority of the nation . of course the power hungry are going to cry foul , they wrote it to benefit themselves ! it's the same story with every one of our nations . the people are just starting to realize this fact and things are beginning to change . it's interesting to me to see how all of this will play out .

im a metric and all other associated systems user . today is not 9 / 1 / 09 here - its 1 / 9 / 09 . glenn is an english name , and the english use the aforementioned system .. case closed like on a & e .
but our lives don't have any inherent meaning . we create meaning for ourselves .
we have four of the world's " most liveable cities ". edit : four of the top ten in 2008 ' s poll .
try the o'reilly python cookbook . gets you right into everyday uses of the language for every purpose . since you can already code , it's probably best to learn by example .
just launch some game and look how their eyes start to tear up .
i was floored how well cranston nailed that middle aged chemistry teacher gone wrong character ... he's a really good actor . i haven't watched a series this good in a really long while .
late nineties , i was a film student at concordia , montreal . i had a part time job as a projectionist with the university . i was called in last minute to replace another projectionist in a projection booth i was completely unfamiliar with . i was given a rare print of brakhages ' prelude 1 ' to screen , and told to be very careful with it . i had no idea how to load the projector correctly , and the film played for about thirty seconds before jamming . everybody watched as a beautiful hand painted frame of celluoid overheated , bubbled up and melted in front of everybody , then the film unjammed and kept rolling . nobody realized it wasn't part of the film .
not just a point , but the whole sword as it were .
think of some good passwords that you can remember . then combine them .
i found there was no easier way to get anyone from any political position to think i'm an asshole than to say that i didn't think that tim russert was a particularly interesting interviewer and that he offered no original analysis .

the best thing to do is prevention . adblocking or dns controls like opendns and category filtering .
hm , never mind me , why did i not just google it previously ?
education should be declared a national emergency . seriously .
i indiscriminately downvoted and upvoted them to give your lives purpose .
on a side note . ( am too a german ) i also can't believe how people seriously can call obama a communist or socialist . the guy is more conservative or right wing than our conservative party . i also believe that angela merkel would seriously shit her pant suit if someone told her that she is the cancelor of a socialist country ( same goes for sweden etc .). our health care system was invented by bismarck who was anything but a socialist . he wasn't even liberal . hell , social democrats and liberals ( in the old world sense of the word ) were his political enemies . but he understood , that it must be common sense , that if you don't support the weak , a society isn't worth shit . simple as that . i follow us - politics very closely and i sometimes even get as frustrated as some americans . i don't get the shit obama gets . why do the poorest in the us support the people who help them the least ? where are the people who supported obama in the election now , to defend him from these idiots ? considering the shit he gets all over the place , i am not suprised he is thinking about dropping the public option . seems like the right wing nutters have a much louder voice these days . people like glenn beck wouldn't be on tv over here . not because he wouldn't be allowed to speak out . but because people wouldn't want to watch someone who is obviously clinically insane to form their opinion on pretty much anything . rant over
yeah i actually read through the thread again last night and decided to give it a spin . very basic , but it does exactly what i want . thanks for the recommendation ! )
i guess some people just have to stick their dick in anything . that's ok though , you can still be president !
no , because they've proven themselves consistently dishonest before . even a stopped clock is right twice a day .
the simple answer is ... marry her . seriously .
you think that's bad ? i've already ejaculated to this picture ...
indiana jones may want to have a word with you .
waiting for antyviruses !
i was exactly at that point about 2 months ago . the nausea comes from the endorphins your body uses to give you runner's high and keep you going when you've hit your wall . if you're interested in getting better at running , you have to remember it's all biological . the more often you run ( slower , and not necessarily longer distances ), the more mitochondria per cell your body will start making on its own , and that nausea will slowly come at a later point in your running and then just disappear . studies also show that doing hard run - walking - hard run - walking - hard run intervals can be just as effective . of course , that's only if you care . i just really love feeling invincible . i can now run 5 miles , no problems .
i'm a linux user . however , i think the constant , " everything microsoft is evil " rants are no good for anyone . putting others down to support your own views is never productive .
i have house of leaves on my shelf and i want to read it but i get creeped easily . i've always been creeped out by stephen king's short story the mist .
good point . i should have said one of the first us female soldiers to die in iraq . killed by morality . she couldn't take being evil .
icarus seems more apt .
the fdic was barred from charging premiums to banks that it classified as well - capitalized and well - managed the fdic was the one who declared that those insolvent banks were well managed and wouldn't go under , and thats why a lot of people are claiming that fdic was mismanaged and failed at regulation . thats not to shift any of the blame away from the jackasses in congress who changed the law though .
it's just a standard procedure to make sure no sexual assault is taking place on either end . the policeman did things correctly . get over it .
i'll also add the spanish tendency to stop for the hottest part of the day and resume things in the evening - including very late dinners . i'm australian and if there was ever another country that would benefit from adopting the siesta it's bloody australia .
when i was tripping on shrooms on a beach , looking up at the countless stars , i realised that humans are inherently good and that evil only comes from ignorance and misguidedness . hitler fully believed that he was doing the right thing as did stalin and others who we would consider to be evil . evil stemming from selfishness comes from a lack of understanding of others . i understood then that evil could be eradicated through education , understanding and a sense of harmony .
wow man , why are you so tight about this subject .
thanks for the extra spam . until you give us more options for sorting and searching our messages , why don't you cut down on the message spam , instead of increasing it ?
not that i'm not saying your criticisms aren't valid on some level , but you don't think safety or hygiene concerns regarding child daycare ( or heck , even hair care ) are valid at all ?
bring a flask or two to avoid pricey drinks at the festival . if you're driving , bring bicycles . they can be rented on the cheap here , too . the traffic this weekend is going to be hell . try veggie heaven for cheap & fast chinese - style food all - vegan / vegetarian food . also mother's is a vegetarian place with much more class & variety . that's all i have for now , but i'll try to get back at you if i think of anything or if you have any more questions .
he is vehemently opposed to microkernels . his complaint is about slow performance , and the problem is anything that slows down the system , so he is definitely not going to let linux go microkernel until a microkernel is faster than a monolithic one .
depends how important the subject is . if it is an immediate concern i will ask a question and try to get them to rephrase what they are saying . if it is not something immediate i will ask them to summarize it in an email so that i have documentation and a reminder . that way i can read what they are saying rather than try to listen to them . if the subject matter is some random relatively unimportant topic like what they are having for dinner later i will just nod and say uh - huh or something to pretend i am listening / care .
yeah that sounds like it will go over really well considering his previous communication ...
tell her to be easier on you right off the bat . and men : take this as a lesson . it doesn't feel good at first !
worrying about being a bad kisser will make you worse than any amateur technique . if she wants you to kiss her , you could have no lips at all and she'll still love it .
so when you invite someone in your house , and they shit on your carpet , you're just like " it's cool . i mean , i did let you in after all . . ."? yeah , no .
either that , or they think our contracts to build elevators are insane , since we're requesting them with non - functional buttons :)
i just bought it and played for about an hour . the controls make me feel like i'm piloting a two ton whale on an ice rink and the action was slow in unfolding .
it actually reads like a humerous proposal that way .
i'm not positive to what aspect your referring to but here's a response ... as i've had time to think about ( and believe me , for two years after the event all i was able to do was dwell on what the hell happened to me ) i came to the conclusion that a cocktail of factors caused my meltdown . they were , in no particular order : being away from home for the first time ( i had never gone to sleep away camp ) being at a new school ( college ) and required to make all new friends adjusting to the increased work load of college trying to maintain a long - distance relationship with my girlfriend of then a year from high school smoking pot and taking adderall meditating on the meaning of nothingness ( i'm semi - serious about this one )
kind of defeats the purpose of the game , especially in ravenholm . the point of ravenholm is not how fast you can dash through it , it's the creepy atmosphere of all these zombies chasing you in dark corners .
i have found that if i don't have any dairy products they leave me alone , i have tested this out personally and with friends camping over the last 10 years . milk lots of bites . my fiance and i had been camping several days with relatively few bites maybe one or two a day , then she had milk for breakfast , i didn't , she proceeded to be eaten alive when we returned to camp . they still weren't biting me . on other occasions i got bit , but it always came down to if i had dairy products within the last couple of days . if you get bit a lot , try abstaining from any dairy products for a couple of days before you go out you'll thank me . and no , i didn't discover it myself , i saw it on the news almost 20 years ago , university researchers claimed that diet affected probability of being bitten , and that dairy products greatly raised your chances of being bitten . as a kid i was drinking up to a gallon of milk a day and couldn't go out in any mosquito population without being bitten . the chance viewing of that news cast allowed me to finally enjoy the outdoors , camping / hiking etc . i just had to give up dairy before i undertook those activities . serious , there were times when i was bitten 20 - 30 times a minute , and nobody around me was getting bitten at all . i stopped drinking milk , and the mosquitoes stopped focusing on me .
i don't think that's true . do you have a citation for your claim ? also , i don't think it is right to do it for any reason other than a health concern . which it isn't .
apropos nothing , that is how we mac users feel about the pc world . away with you !
he's like ricky gervais's cooler brother .
it's quite a serious shortfall , that the article gives neither the exact question asked , nor any details of the type ( married , engaged , single , in a relationship , old , young ) of respondent . i know it could easily get too technical and lose coherence , but a little basic information could really assist in understanding whether there was a strong bias in the questioning which led to these conclusions .
" sister , show me the way ". " this rod will be your doom !" fuckin kilik ...
our doctors see that we have a great influence on each other ( the good kind ) and accept that . it's the nurses on the ward who had a bit of a problem with it , and didn't really understand how we managed at first . but now they know our story and how we interact and they're okay with it too . so a non - issue for us now , but i had to tell off a nurse pretty firmly one time when my girlfriend was admitted .
here ( uk ) a sister is a senior nurse ( as in rank not age ).
yes , the reason many us prisons use the word " penitentiary " in their name is because it was about rehabilitation way back in the 19th century at one point . penitentiary was a place for penance .
we , the reddit community , should do that everywhere !! i love that idea ! although , what i love more is not leaving my home .
one small step for france ... one giant leap for mankind . the more countries that affirm the strength of the gpl , the stronger its international weight .
i did have to ask where the walrus was ... but that was due to a naming issue with the printers ..
i agree about the weather , but i've recently moved away from the uk to istanbul .... do that and you will quickly have a list of the great things about the uk .
have you ever sneezed while brushing your teeth ?
yeah it's pretty striking . it means that when peopel say they felt like it was just yesterday that they were xyz they really mean that is what it feels like . it is not just an expression as you presumed . the reason it is good to know this is do stuff now . don't sit around and get depressed about it . use your knowledge that you don't have infinite time to get over whatever fear is holding you back and do stuff now . not tomorrow or next week but now .
the us is the only " western " country that you have to be 21 to buy alcohol . the us is the only " western " country where in most places , you have to be 18 to have sex and they dont even have near age exceptions . and what is worse , this law is actually enforced . the us is the only " western " country where in many of its states , everyone and their underaged dog can get a gun , with no psychological evaluation and no training . the us is the only country where religion is so important , where it is acceptable to have their president claim that god told him to invade iraq , where their mainstream presidential candidates wear magic underwear and believe in even more absurd fairytales than the christian ones . by many aspects , the us is a third world country . my prediction is that in the future , their major ( and fairly liberal ) cities will get walled off and will be " civilized " and everything outside the walls be turned into a mad max wasteland , with immigrants , guns , uneducated religion wackos and barely any laws , a true wild west . in some way , this has already happened ( except the walls are more social than real ).
haha i refreshed at least 5 times before i realized what was going on . facepalm myself ...
spirit in the sky - norman greenbaum .
they did that where i worked . a couple of people were laid off . i wasn't . i guess i don't reddit enough .
how old were you when you won ? were you a student or what job before ?
it's so educational !
i was hoping to read that she'd stolen a hairbrush :(
it's like smelling bad milk . if you do , you just gotta make sure that everyone else around you smells it too .
totally . i think i can see the pixels around that nude girl .
depopulation would help with global warming .
mathematics doesn't address that sort of thing . you've entirely missed the point of my analogy . mathematics is the logical study of rigorously defined abstract objects and systems whereas philosophy is the logical study of things defined more intuitively . there are no issues with semantics when debating a mathematical truth , whereas this is a major point of contention in general philosophy . a philosopher tries to wrestle truth out of a set of assumptions about humanity , morality , society , etc , whereas a mathematician chooses a small set of axioms that prove more abstract truths and leaves the application up to someone else . similarly , a psychologist deals with intuitive notions of " the mind " and " the subconscious ", etc ; there are a slew of terms and ideas dealing with subjective experience . while there is a fair bit of experimentation , a great majority of psychology is based on natural intuition about the human mind . cognitive science is not : everything ascertained about the mind in that field is subject to far more rigor and the structure of experimentation . however , let me try to answer your question anyway , absurd as it is ( would you ask a theoretical physicist to tell you the best way to maintain a car's engine ?): our universe is a giant mathematical system . at the quantum level , each particle is a mathematical object which is part of the larger equation that describes the entire universe . we can study small sections of the universe at once , but as you include more particles , the equation quickly becomes extremely complex . without getting into a truly giant post , go read about cellular automata and why they are so interesting to theoretical physicists ( who are really just a subset of mathematicians ) if you have not done so already . the shortest answer i can give is that our universe could easily be a specific system with a handful of very simple rules out from which all the complex behavior that we observe emerges . asking " why ?" again is a question which it is impossible to answer . you can come up with whatever mysticism you want to explain it ( gods , etc ), but no amount of reasoning can reveal the " why " of the bottom - most layer of reality . not from within it , at any rate , and , since our bodies and minds exist within it , we are trapped in this universe ( unless this turns out to be some simulation and the guy in charge decides to translate us into robots in their own universe or something ).
sigh while i didn't like bush , statements like that are so idiotic they make the side you're promoting sound stupid . yes , the world is just that simple and there are no other factors to consider .
backwards compatible with c . literally every valid c program that doesn't use the new reserved keywords will run as it did before . object oriented in smalltalk fashion ; uses messaging . duck typing ( sort of ); runtime customizability . you can use cocoa .
short answer : he's not interested . move on . sorry . (
the name does imply fried chicken .
few comments : add a light - dimmer on the hot line to your blower . it will allow you to adjust temp eliminate all plastic parts , or you're going to inhale off - gases from the plastic ( that ball - valve is plastic on the inside ..), regulate temp via dimmer wash all parts in 99 % rubbing alcohol prior to use ( and let dry .. duh )
correction : there are 64,000 possible permutations , not combinations .
the even rarer picard look of disapproval .
