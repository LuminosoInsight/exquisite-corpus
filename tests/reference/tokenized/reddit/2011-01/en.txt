this comic was done 21 years ago . i don't know if jim davis is capable of this anymore .
i've tried a few , but they all say updating , or don't say anything about the new blocks / items at all . i don't want to have to check every single texture pack website ever . i was just wondering if anyone knows of any that have updated
yes , and the basement bar scene is just as good . definitely the best acting i've ever witnessed in a movie . i think these scenes are highly under appreciated .

sexy cora under anesthesia this was actually the first video that came up when i did a search on tubegalore .
just want to mention that some guns are made to be as close in weight to the real thing as possible .
i ain't claiming otherwise at all . you seem to be implying these things are mutually exclusive . yeah , i'm living that dream and that dream is hard fucking work and constant abuse from random people on the internet . if hd is feeling worn down from that i can't blame him in the slightest . i'm going to my gp on monday for a possible stress - related illness , which i assure you is absolutely wonderful . this is reality . there are no people who ' just play videogames all day for a living '. i work longer hours than most ( unless you're implying 84 hour work weeks are par for the course in western countries ), so does hd , trying to detract from that just demonstrates a lack of knowledge as well as just a smidge of jealousy on your part . that's my point . you don't get to rail on the guy as a result of your own ignorance .
can i ask , if you could go back in time and be raised with just your biological family and not the foster children , would you ? if you don't want to answer , obviously it's fine .
i was walking behind a guy in the street the other day . he was talking to his girlfriend . talking about his ex gf , who he was with for a long time and had lots of trouble . they were walking with a little girl 4 - 6years old . he just said to his new girlfriend " if i had know my ex was such a bitch i would never have had a child wither her !" i felt so sad for the little girl .
i agree living in sydney is getting so expensive it is almost impossible for young couples like myself and my husband to get a chance in the rental market , let alone buying a house under 400,000 .
don't really care .
the girl's not bad either .
true , not everyone thinks this . but many of the readers do find these characters to be incredibly romantic , without ever bothering to look at what they actually do . i'm not saying that all women are like this , so i am really not sure why you seem to be taking it personally ( if you are not then i apologize ), but it is hard to argue that there are not large crowds of women out there fantasizing about a character that stalked his future girlfriend .
that is the silliest feature suggestion i have ever heard . i like it .

i thought alcoholism itself wasn't genetic but addictive tendencies were . not trying to call you wrong ( especially since i have no sources backing this up , nor do i care about the difference enough to try and look it up ), but i thought i had read that somewhere . in this case it likely wouldn't matter too much , as there would still be a possibility of him becoming an alcoholic . on the other side of the coin , my father is definitely an alcoholic . he isn't a violent drunk by any means and he has always been an incredible father and grandfather to my kids . i just can't remember the last time he went a day without having at least 3 beers . i bring this up because i am not an alcoholic , nor have i ever been addicted to anything . so it seems that it is possible to drink and not be an alcoholic even if your father / mother were / are .
beckinsale ? what's she done lately ?
i've been using a melitta ready set joe pourover maker for a few months instead of my french press . i like that it's as fresh as the press , and cleaner in flavor . i would assume that a metal pourover filter would result in an even fresher cup , given my pre - french press experience using metal baskets . i would also assume that the central advantage is not flavor , but just in having a reusable filter , when the paper filters are more obscure . you're not going to just stroll into your regular grocery store and find chemex filters . unless your grocery store is much more awesome than mine .

under lake winnipeg , as in a tunnel ? seriously ? or did you mean a submerged cable ? in any case i had not heard of that option .
i'm guessing the op has had several of those relationships . i'm even guessing he's pretty good at those . well ... guessing or hypothesizing isn't helping the op . you basically added you whole narrative to disagree with my advice ( as someone who has fucked a virgin ). how many dates have you been on where you didn't get laid ? he said , he's been on 4 . that isn't that many . he's still learning to date . the more dates , the more comfortable he will get and maybe up his chances . everyone at some point is a virgin . it's not like he has some rare disease that is just specific to him . my advice , based on his wanting to " get some " is that if it's only about losing his vcard , find a hooker . most women who just want to get laid and have no desire to get to the know the guy , don't want to teach class . also ... there is no grand seduction . every woman and what they find sexy is totally different . communication is what will get him laid . and ... to be fair , every single person on the planet has the risk of being friend - zoned at some point ; many of which are not virgins .
better get more booze first .
i really think you should write ( not type , bust out a pencil ) your letter , and then just read it . read it 2 or 3 times and see if the anger , hurt and passion that went into it are still coursing through your veins . it'll most likely be way less intense because you got it out of your system . whether you realize it or not , you've been writing this letter since the relationship ended . every time you start to get worked up and have to go distract yourself , it's because you are retaining so much emotion from it all , and you have to get it out . i can write things down in the heat of the moment and when i go back to read it i'm like , " wow , i wrote that ?" i sometimes literally won't recognize my own writing because the mind - set i had at the time isn't the same one i'm in afterward ; i got it out . you can absolutely express yourself without it reaching her . she hurt you , she treated you like shit , she deserves to feel the wrath of the anger she's left you with , but she's gone . she's no longer taking any actions to hurt you , but you're left with the hurt . so now it's up to you to help yourself , and leave her completely out of it . address the letter to her , write it just as you would if you intended to send it . but don't send it . if you send her an e - mail , with " some things that were left unsaid ," it won't help you . it really really just won't . there will still be things unsaid . you'll remember something after you send it and then you'll be right back in this situation where you wonder if you should add that last word . all the words between you two have been said . you'll be disappointed if she doesn't respond , and if she does , it'll only suck you into this deeper . no good can come of it . she didn't care about your feelings then so why would she now ? she didn't take care of the feelings you shared with her so stop sharing them with her ! writing is a good outlet , but only let it get as far as your desk .
do bear in mind that you're the other half of this inane conversation , perhaps you ought to stop your end as well , as you've admitted it's a completely pointless discussion .

tamora pierce is still one of my fav authors and i'm now in my 20s , i've read everything she's written . garth nix and this trilogy is also at the top of my list . though they don't have a strong female lead , i also enjoyed nix's keys to the kingdom series . gotta love that young adult fiction !
i actually think it's more intellectually honest to not make exceptions for rape : if they truly care about the child more than the woman and her behavior , it shouldn't matter how that child is conceived . of course , i support the right to choose in any case , but i can at least muster up a smidgen of respect for people that are consistent .

complete mod is great because it doesn't change what stalker is . it does , like the titles suggests , make the game complete . it makes the game so much more enjoyable , immersive and atmospheric , while it still feels like the same game . it also improves textures and other things to make the game look nicer . the weathering is great and rain is amazing . i love it at night when it starts to pour down with rain and you're in the middle of a firefight , and all you can hear are screaming russian voices . i've played through soc 3 times and it was best with complete mod . if you want the complete s.t.a.l.k.e.r .: soc experience , play it with complete mod .

i have a strange " want " to go scavenging through an abandoned town / city for valuables . jewelry , copper , coins / money .... whatever i can get . i realize that anything scavenged there would be contaminated , but the compulsion is still there for me . parts of films like " the road " and " i am legend " that involving scavenging though dead cities .... have a great appeal to me .
i totally agree . i would give anything for that kind of stability . the problem is that those kind of jobs just don't exist anymore . not even in the food service industry . you're likely to be laid off or fired (" not a good fit ") so the employer can hire the next 8 / hr person without giving you a raise . i wouldn't mind a career in food service if it would guarantee being in the middle class , health insurance , dental , sick leave , and vacation time . but health insurance for waiters / waitresses ? i doubt it will ever happen again in the usa .
a person who is enlightened will have fewer conflicting emotions . they will be quiet and not boastful and will get along well with whoever they meet . often they will seem to radiate a positive , cheerful , and loving quality . if you want to " test " a teacher , criticize them mildly . if you get a lot of defensiveness or they criticize you in return , they probably aren't enlightened . if they smile and take the criticism in a good natured way , that's a good sign .

in spanish class the ( withered old ) teacher said the cockroach referred to a supply train that traveled during the mexican revolution , but only infrequently due to lack of fuel . those singing about it jokingly claimed it wasn't fuel shortage , but rather that it had run out of marijuana . i find no backing at all online on that , other then that a myriad of versions with various veiled political meanings indeed circulated during the war . no idea if she made it up or what . later in life , however , i reflected that having a classroom full of students sing a song about smoking weed as a way to drill spanish probably isn't as common as it used to be .
same deal with aspartame . any and all evidence against it is purely anecdotal .
i don't know if i fully agree , unfortunately . atheism would necessarily erase the negative effects of religion . i mean look what nationalism did : when people turned away from god or decided they can have something along side it ( and to be clear , i am not saying , " bad things happen when you turn away from god ") they instead put that energy towards blind " faith " in their country . the same level of fervor and zealotry was there , they just found another outlet .
perhaps not actually forced but for those of us just wanting to sit down and relax with a little tv only to be suddenly interrupted , on every channel , it certainly felt forced .
called nasal cycle , and seems fairly legit .
this is a pretty damn good watch . i think it gets the best when former president clinton rips how fox news runs their show in the second part , though . couldn't be more truthful in this interview . you can tell he's genuinely honest with what he perceives and what is going on . look how many times he admits his mistakes , will ya ? bipartisanship is obviously not the way to go , but fuck the republican party lately .
he did turn in a really solid performance in that movie . i don't recall the specifics of the scene but at one point he and shia labeouf get into an argument that turns into a fight . great scene from two actors who have otherwise proven very mediocre .

no it's not , a cameraman is applying a technical skill to convey a visual message ( it's not like using a point - and - shoot camcorder ), whereas a mascot is standing in a fuzzy suit and waving . one's goal is to be a transparent eye while the others is to get parents to pay you to take photos with their kids . just because somebody uses a large piece of equipment for work doesn't mean he's begging for attention . worst . analogy . ever .
i would argue that the us government's actions since 9 / 11 have been a much greater threat to our security than terrorism itself has been . the wars have been shown to breed insurgency and terrorism . the only way to stop terrorism is to make our government stop terrorizing them , or funding israel in terrorizing them .

the time dilation from gps satellites is mostly a result of gravitational time dilation from general relativity , not speed - related time dilation . and gps satellites travel at 4000 m / s , and i'd say that's pretty mind boggling fast . at that speed , the time dilation effect is about 0.0000075s per day .

even so , as the victim in the situation their chance of great bodily harm / death reached it's potential when the criminal or perpetrator drew his weapon and / or made deadly threats . the victim's chances of great bodily harm or death is not increased by his deployment of a weapon . that threat and / or potential was already present . since it would be illegal to deploy a deadly weapon in a case of of mere insult i would assume that you are not including that type of situation . i would agree with you if you are . the only time that deployment of a deadly weapon , be that knife , club , or even a gun is legal is after death or great bodily injury has become imminent . in that case , deployment is legal and certainly does not create any more potential threat to the victim then was already present . in the incident of the original poster , multiple attackers were advancing , having already made threats of physical violence . one of them was armed with a deadly weapon . at that point , deploying a firearms only increased the criminals chances of injury . karsh
i recently wrote a story about a similar thought . it's in its first draft , and nobody will read it all the way through due to how far down the page it is , but whatever . i present to you a flash fiction titled : the reason why if you should happen to live as a good christian , you ought to always dress your best after years of preparation , when it finally occurred he was not at all ready . he was standing in the kitchen wearing boxers and a dirty white t - shirt . he was slathering mayonnaise on his sandwich he felt it happen . at first it was like a stomachache or a cramp until the rest of his body jerked violently in space and he was pulled not up as he would've imagined , rather forward and backward and slightly to the left all at the same time . and with that , he was ripped from existence . there was a hole , a void , for half an instant before the world filled in his shape like a flooded footprint in the mud . living as a pure christian is a very difficult endeavor , especially in modern times , which is perhaps the reason he found heaven a great deal more lonely than he had anticipated . he was also mildly disappointed to see his supernatural body appear just as it had on earth , even down to his clothes . he had purchased a suit for just this occasion , and in retrospect felt like an idiot for assuming there would be some notice or warning , and time to get ready . his decades of pious living yielded a particularly insignificant number of acquaintances in the physical world , though there were those who noticed his disappearance — three exactly . they were his manager , his landlord , and his mailman and they were concerned with , respectively , filling his position , what to do with his furniture , and where to put his piling bills . eventually , his work duties were given with a slightly lower - wage replacement , his apartment was rented out to a slightly noisier tenant , and his mail was stacked and stored neatly in a garbage bin . at first the whiteness was blinding , but once he realized he was no longer hindered by eyes , he was able to see the entire planet at once and magnified like a universe - sized panorama . he scoffed at those who were left behind , and tried desperately to convince himself that he did not miss the feeling of gravity tugging at his flesh . he could watch them as ants from afar or so close that they looked like giants , but they paid him as little mind as they did when he was among them . he wanted to shout at them . he wanted to climb inside their brain and manipulate their thoughts to tell them that they are oblivious , that they are cursed and damned . but he couldn't reach them . the rest of the world continued eating , breathing , and sinning without a hiccup , unaware that there ever even was a rapture .
this is nothing at all like jrpgs and the creator has never played any . biggest jrpgs of last few years : ffxiii , lost odyssey , nier , the last remnant , yakuza , dragon quest ix ... etc . none of those have helpless women wanting to be rescued . yakuza has more realistic characters than the vast majority of western games . oh big deal the fashion and style is a bit different than western games , that means they must be awful cos male characters have long hair ! nooo i demand all male characters have shaved heads as they do in western games ! the complaint about grinding - what western game doesn't have repetitive combat ? call of duty is pure grind . the fact is jrpgs tend to be a lot more content rich than western games and that's not a bad thing . mass effect 2 , highest rated wrpg is only 10 hours long , it's got no significant locations and it's got generic 3rd person shooter combat . the sacrifice thing is a common trope , that's the only insightful thing in this whole image . but it's quite common in western games too ( e.g . end of fallout 3 ) and worldwide fiction ( the bible , star wars , etc .).
what about the lag in shifting ? every car i've driven with the triptronic had a huge lag between when i would move the stick and the transmission actually shifted . the cars were a mini - base model and an s , acura tl , mazda3 , some bmw 3 series , and a tiburon . all of those cars had at least a 3 - 5 second lag in shifting , and never down shifted unless i was going less than 20mph .
sure they can . infinity ward makes call of duty , and treyarch makes zombies . i'm just not sure why treyarch continues to add the previous call of duty game on the same disc as zombies , but with more glitches and less fun . i don't think the games are actually intended to be played though . i think it's just for show .

the only reason to buy a ps3 when you are already a pc gamer is simply exclusive games . you need to watch some videos on ps3 exclusives to see if it's worth buying a ps3 for them . i do think it's worth buying a ps3 for the exclusives and with the best ps2 games getting hd remakes it just gives further reasons to buy one .

was walking out the right thing to do , or in any way a good idea ? absolutely not . it damaged his credibility , deflected attention away from the war memos , and gave his enemies more ammunition against him . i honestly don't understand how anyone can disagree with this . it's pretty fucking obvious ! i absolutely agree . what he did will be twisted , damaging his character and drawing attention away from the leak . however , it hasn't changed my view of the man , wikileaks , or drawn my attention away from the leak . i think it's a glimpse of the sad state of the media . she just wanted what would be more sensational . which unfortunately is him possibly raping a woman , rather than the deaths of over 100,000 people .

progressives aren't " blaming " anyone but the shooter , but you can't divorce this heinous act from its politics being that he targeted political / government figures for assassination . maybe this guy lashed out because the roads to a better life and career have been closed off to him because women need more college degrees . you are so full of shit , dude . and then you go on to say " it has nothing to do with masculinity ." which is it ?
i noticed that as well . maybe they used an old calendar they should have thrown out long ago . either way , it looks like they tend to procrastinate .

stereotype and perhaps give up on a whole group of ( homeless ) people in need of serious help . that's why they do this instant celebrity thing in the first place , so they have reason to point to when imperfection inevitably happens , they can scream " we did good , these people are just hopeless and beneath us ! see ! we have done all we can ! we are exceptional and deserve everything we want ! not them , they are not worthy ! give it all to us , us , us !"

congrats ! but please read this article from the nyt that discusses cordon bleu , for profit institutions and student debt . is no connection b / w le cordon bleu in france and the schools in the us . career education center leases the cordon bleu name from the french institute . if you are dead - set on going to culinary school , i would recommend you look into a community college ( which would be infinitely cheaper ), or if you are incredibly serious , the cia or a similar program . edit : do some informational interviews before you sign anything or make your next step . try and talk to the chefs in the field you want to go into ( see if you can talk to them before or after their shift at the restaurant ). find out how they got there , find out what they recommend you do , and , most importantly , find out what they think of cordon bleu - america or other cooking schools . remember , these are the people who will hire you , and if they think your school is a joke , they probably won't hire you .

it's good to know that everything i suspected about the higher - ups when i ran the register is true . those people always came off as complete idiots . i used to work at a waldenbooks ( was one of the ones closed last year ), and i think my favourite part was how they'd send us the same amount of chocolate as a superstore a few blocks away . we'd get too much to even store and would just end up throwing at least half of every shipment away . every other one tended to come before we had even sold the other half of the previous shipment , so sometimes we'd just have to toss the whole thing . and then we'd get yelled at for , say , ordering books in for customers that never got picked up . they called it a waste of money . the people making these decisions are idiots . they would take away our ability to satisfy customers ' needs and then yell at us later because our profits went down . they'd start up a week - long discount on some books with no warning , send us signs for it , and then cancel it after two days because no one was taking part in it . they'd send us sheets of coupons to " bring in customers " but no signage for it . they'd have employees fired and then spend the time / money hiring and training an inferior replacement ( who of course got fired soon after as well ). jesus christ that company was a mess .

thanks for saying this . reading through this thread really baffled me . my son screamed his head off for the first three months of his life . he cried and cried and cried and never seemed to sleep . he couldn't be let to rest or play more than five minutes because he quickly turned back to screaming and crying . at no point during that time did i ever even think the words written in this post's link , and at no point did i think anything akin to the ridiculousness written above your comment . infants cry for a reason . they cry because they are hungry . they cry because they have to go to the bathroom . the cry because the light is too bright , or that the room is dark and they can't see anything . they cry because they are alone . they cry because they do not understand certain sounds . they cry because eating food fills their stomachs , and that creates pressure in them ( but they don't understand pressure or why it's there , or what food does , because they are infants ). they cry because they do not understand anything at all and because they are taught from day one that crying brings them interaction , warmth , safety , and care . it took my wife and i three months to finally understand our son was trying to tell us : " i'm allergic to all forms of dairy , including mother's milk !" and that crying got us to a doctor's office , and a specialist , and made us contact our daycare providers and made us write to our insurance agency about getting him the formula he needed to thrive ( and that formula cost about 1000 per month ) and to not shit blood out his asshole . and i don't look back on that time with any sort of animosity ; if i do , it's toward myself for waiting through three months of people telling us : " oh , that's just colic ... it'll pass ." yeah , these people aren't bad parents , per se , but they are awful people . they seem to think it's unfair to be a parent . they think their kids are difficult . they think no one appreciates them , and they think they're wasting their time . what they don't do is take the time to realize that an infant doesn't understand language , and that our norms ( to them ) are a series of movements connected to nothing ; they seem to think that their children ( at any age ) actually owe them something . and that's bullshit . know what ? i don't indulge my kid by listening to his crying . know what ? i don't spoil him by talking with him . know what ? i know he doesn't appreciate anything , because he doesn't understand what appreciation means . know what ? because my wife and i actually sat down with our son during those difficult months and stayed with him and listened to him and worked things out with him , we've got a kid whose verbal capacity is far beyond the expectations for his age . know what ? my kid can drink milk now , because my wife and i listened to his crying . i don't give a single fuck for people who complain that being a parent is hard . it is . if you didn't understand that going in , your child is worse off for you .
look . accept this fact . you will never enter canada legally with a terrorism charge on your record . canada sees the us legal system as infallible when it comes to convictions . you are dreaming of leaving this country , you will need to look south to mexico or south america .

you're right . absolutely right .
he's surveying in an archaeology site . when you survey , a telescope appears , points in a direction and has a light to indicate how close an artefact is ( red far , yellow close , green nearby ). often to unearth just one artefact requires surveying multiple times and following the direction of the telescope like a trail . six seconds is the cool - down time of the surveying ability .
once the image starts loading , it's really out of res's hands . if it only partially loads , then the download has probably failed midstream , or chrome is barfing on inconsistent data in a way that other browsers may be more tolerant of ? hard to say for sure , but what i can say is that res doesn't do any of the " loading " of the images -- it just outputs an img tag and lets your browser do the rest ... so this is 99 % likely to be a non - res issue .

the tides things is a bait and switch . if silverman had taken the time to explain it , dumbass would have just mentioned something else like " yeah , but where did it all come from ?" silverman was correct that he didn't need to answer it . after all , there was a time when we didn't know what caused the tides , and islam , christianity and the rest were still false . fox and friends aren't interested in any scientific explanations . they are interested in propaganda -- pick a message and stick with it no matter what . silverman's tactic was perfect for this environment -- just let them know that magic men don't cause tides ( or anything else ) and that they're idiots , and move on .

goddamn i hate when people speed up when you try to pass . i once was following someone going 50 in a 60 . two lane country road , dotted yellow line , the usual . so of course to pass you actually have to time it and gun it to avoid any awkwardness with oncoming traffic . i get in the left lane to pass this asshole ( which , by the way , i was keeping a good 2 - 3 seconds behind until i decided to pass ), and she speeds up to 75 with me . fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu . had to go 90 just to not get uncomfortably close to an oncoming semi .
hey . stop ruining this for me , okay ? [](/ foreveralone " this is the only interaction i have with women besides the old lady who works at the grocery store .")
you could have left our the pic and i still would have upvoted this .
again i disagree . your metaphor is comparing a limited resource to a unlimited resource . so let's compair it to taxes on alcohol , an unlimited resource . if more people demand more alcohol , you make more factories . same if people want more bandwidth , you upgrade your infrastructure . the consumer doesn't pay more for a case of 24 cans then a 6 pack , and taxes won't be raised for drinking more beer . but the thing is , more of the same should be free , there is no problem with the marketing , as you stated . as an example , telus put 1.2 billion into upgrading their infrastructure , and the consumer is not paying for that . on the flip side of the issue , telus has made a statement that they do not , as of yet , plan on doing ubb because they are ready to deal with the demand from their customers of today and tomorrow . canada already pays some of the most money for some of the slowest internet around the world . so what we are seeing is not a raising of the cost to deal with the logistics of bandwidth , what we are seeing is price gouging and the free - market gone wrong with lack of choice in isps in our country . it's a sad state of affairs , and this is absolutely the thin edge of the wedge on the issue of net - neutrality . be it the very sliver of said wedge , its still the start .

&# 3232 ;\_&# 3232 ; your advice echoes that of several enlisted guys i know ( usmc ): " there is no such thing as ' cheating '; winning is everything ." that being said , you're fucking yourself over in the long run if you don't study / train / prepare etc . and you find that you need to cheat to succeed .

i think the majority of / r / atheism is probably american or at least from another western country ( uk , aus etc .). if you live in one of these countries and are being oppressed by a religion it is christianity not islam . i think that's pretty much where the bias stems from . they hate religions that directly impact them more .

by " tablet and smartphone " they mean the low powered cpus that power them to compete with the likes of arm and nvidia . not actually the devices themselves , amd and intel are not in that market at all . that title was probably chosen to appeal to the general reader .
his comment is " been a while since we've seen steve and cosette !" but throws them right at us . i read the comic every day and only vaguely remembered who steve was and had no idea who cosette was . he really needs to give a quick re - intro if even he realizes that it's been a while since we've seen the characters . or give everyone better distinguishing features . edit : note that i never said the comic was bad or unfunny , just a little unnecessarily difficult .

that character , cody , is from the final fight series . a snes sidescroller brawler where the players would beat up gang members and eat whole chickens they found on the ground . no zombies that i can remember , but cody and the whole cast of final fight are pretty manly , though i would have picked haggar for this comic .

back in the american wild west there was serious need of telegraph operators . anybody with the right skills could go in to a shop , set down and demonstrate their mastery of the craft and get a job . this fueled vagrancy on the scale of a cyberpunk novel . i think we’re getting back to those days , good programmers can just pick up and move wherever the skills are needed .

i could go off on my usual rant about wages not equalling income ( more americans have more benefits and bonuses ) or the ' 70s being a cherry picked time to compare against ( inflation was about to go through the roof ). but why bother ? anyone who claims the median american worker was better off in the ' 70s isn't part of the " reality based community ": for one thing , who would give up three or more years of life expectancy right off the top ? that didn't materialize out of thin air : workers ' income increasingly was derived from less strenuous , less hazardous jobs , and that income was spent on better ( and , yes , more expensive ) health care .
from what i gather , none of the women are norwegian .
for some reason this came to my head - “ it's shite being palestinian ! we're the lowest of the low . the scum of the fucking earth ! the most wretched , miserable , servile , pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilization . some hate the israelis . i don't . they're just wankers . we , on the other hand , are colonized by wankers . can't even find a decent culture to be colonized by . we're ruled by effete assholes . it's a shite state of affairs to be in , abdul , and all the fresh air in the world won't make any fucking difference !” p.s . i’m being sarcastic . i’m pro - palestine . i have been to many events . i strongly recommend the ‘ palestinian monologues ’ as a basic source for the atrocities occurring there whilst the world sits idly by . edit : grammar

maybe i just went to a small mid - western school , but when i was in the 8th grade ( 10 years ago ) there were plenty of both male and female " children " having active sex lives . due to the school i went to having 9th and 10th grades integrated within , we had plenty of 12 year olds ( the youngest 8th graders ) around 15 year olds . several dated . some may have thought it was weird , but no one really made any fuss about it . adults , especially those with kids , tend to think that 12 year olds are young , innocent children . it may very well be true that they don't understand the ramifications of their actions , but this was the age when i was first introduced to drugs ( hard drugs ), alcohol , and sex .
