im afraid i agree . if you see an accident developing , stop . if you hit someone , youre in the wrong . she could have been like me - hard of hearing so doesnt hear the warning or realise it is aimed at her , and physically disabled so cant move out of the way quickly ( especially when limited hearing gives little notice ). she may also have been an idiot . but if you could have seen her and stopped , and didnt , then im sorry but i dont see you getting off . if people are behind me , i stop . if they run into me , it is then their fault . but i dont keep going into a person , whatever i think of them !

i love that the everyone shuts up when lea sings yet sings along with darren .
i take it this isn't the first time you've been asked this ? lol

it might be common but i disagree . its absolutely vital to have at least one point in it . its an entire team invis and its best to have it early game when supports are still struggling to get money for sentries .
jon was here , now he's gone . i love him and miss him , but there's so much more to look forward to now , let's move on .
what would your reasons be for believing planet of unicorns ? i like the idea , all sorts of people have told me that it's true , when i believe it's true i somehow , i assume magically , gain greater confidence that it is true , and i use the planet of unicorns as an answer to things i don't understand sometimes . if you have valid reason for this belief yet still dont have evidence , then yes , faith would be a valid excuse for this person reason can mean self - justification , or logic . my reason for doing something can be totally irrational , or my logic could be accurate but my assumptions flawed . applying reason to evidence is how we know things are true . if you think there's some way of sorting fact from fiction without evidence by using faith , i'd love to learn what that is . faith can still be questioned this is something that comes up sometimes , so to be clear : when i talk about questioning one's beliefs , i don't mean literally just asking the question , i mean caring about whether it's answered . lots of religious apologists say that they question their beliefs , but just give up and stop caring whenever trying to answer those questions honestly would lead them to change their minds . all of us don't believe things unless there's a reason to , believing in whatever you feel like is called delusion . most of the time everyone believe in things because those reasons pertain to truth as determined by skepticism . the only times they don't , are when the matter is inconsequential , or it's a lie they don't want to question . which regularly happens in matters of politics , religion , and cultural traditions .

sorry for the quality . it was very busy . i was the last one on before the cta worker said that no one else could go on the train and i had to run to make it and had not time to stand to take a good picture . also , i suck at taking pictures . year for a couple weeks a train decorated by cta employees ( the l or chicago transit authority ) ride roundtrip on a certain line ( red line in this case ). they post the schedule so families can come out and bring their kids . case in point , there was a family taking pictures while waiting and getting their kids excited for santa . it was really cute . a man rides in the middle of all the trains on a car dressed as santa on his sleigh . he is out in the open ( poor guy ) and waves to everyone . the cta workers dress as elves and make sure that everyone gets on and off each car safely . it is amazing elaborate . they played christmas music over the intercom . every inch that can be is decorated . everyone is excited to be on , especially the kids . they really love it . i staked it out , letting 3 trains go by so i could get on this one . it was worth it . here is a video if you want to see it in action :
soap and water are cheap , people . ugh . people who address people as “ people ”. people with piss poor table manners . it's not like i'm a real stickler , but for god's sake , use silverware properly and don't talk while you're chewing . no one wants to see that . haha , yeah , and then there’s my father , who’ll stop talking mid - sentence to shove some food down his gob , like it doesn’t bother anybody to be left hanging .
are any of the zulus or greece ?
i absolutely second everyone else who says to put networking first . that said , you are very likely going to have some quiet days . keep them productive . write memos to yourself on points of law that are likely going to come up in your practice area . answer questions on avvo . make flowcharts of when things are due in specific types of proceedings . prepare powerpoint talks that you can present at talks . read new appellate opinions and law blogs . have all your retainer , invoice , and miscellaneous forms in order .
in full agreement . it's part of the system . same as when a one loss pac team is behind a one loss sec team for bcs consideration . part of the system , part of the problem .
i have my office christmas party this evening and we're doing the white elephant gift - swap thing . it's a real estate office so all adults ( the party is in a bar ) and this game has been renamed ' liquor swap ' for the past 4 years . i have an ipad box and want to fill it with miniature bottles of liquor . is this too mean ? i want to do it for a joke but don't want to look like a massive dick for having done so ... thoughts ?

second apocalypse trilogy by r . scott bakker . a set of nine books ( three trilogies ). the first trilogy is " the prince of nothing ," its first book is " the darkness that comes before ." its a fantasy version of the crusades , as though written by tolkien with assistance from hp lovecraft and nietzsche . the later trilogies are more like a fantasy version of judgement day and the coming of the antichrist . its easily the smartest series being written today . and its so dark , after you read it you'll look at grimdark writers like joe abercrombie and mark lawrence and think they're adorable .
we call that san francisco .
is it one bad year though ? i mean he has had some season long stinkers before .
is it building a connection , if it's all about misrepresenting yourself , not actually getting to know the other person , not sharing anything about yourself , and moving only towards the final goal of getting laid ? i would argue that " pickup " is not at all about building a connection ( beyond a physical one ), and that meaningful relationships do not come from strategy .

i'd cry too . totally understandable .
i agree with / u / lostsendhelp . communication seems to be the way to go , here . it seems as though you have different baseline expectations , and you just need to work out what is acceptable and what is not . also , that chicken thing ? not the correct , hygienic way to thaw meat . at all . i would also have been very pissed off about that .

this is the only submission here so far that stays true to the theme of helping your opponents attack each other , and it does so very elegantly . one thing , though : your ability here would have it so that even you can decide to gain control of him until end of turn , which would put a 1 / 1 counter on him and also just be kind of confusing ( you only gained control of him until end of turn , so what happens at the end of the turn since you own him ? i assume you would just keep him , but that might be really confusing to some players ). it might be better as " at the beginning of each opponent's combat phase , that player may ..." also now that i'm thinking of it , i don't know what would happen if an opponent would play a spell that gains permanently gains control of this thing ( with either wording ), like switcharoo , which is something to consider as well .

ud is definitely worth it ! at least the eye shadows are . i freaking love their eye shadows . the primer is meh i think , but they have a large variety of pretty highly pigmented shadows that last a long time and go on with ease . the only thing that sucks and i know this is with most glittery shadows , is that the glittery ones seem to puke glitter all over while you're applying it . i just solved that problem by applying my eye makeup first ( except mascara ) and then applying my foundation and everything else .
done . range vs . range is some texas hold'em training software i wrote ( i'm now rewriting it as a web application .) it's very advanced training .
i use republic wireless . i absolutely recommend it without reservation . it has some very big plusses . it also has had some major issues that have mostly been corrected . mostly -- there are still issues , but they are a lot less frequent and a lot less severe . on the other hand , it's 20 bucks a month . here's the idea : republic will try to use a wifi connection whenever possible . this means if you pull into mcdonald's , you can make a call over mcdonald's wifi . that is automatic . if it can't find a wifi signal , then it will use sprint cellular . it is expected ( required actually ) that you have a wifi router at home . this is not unreasonable these days , as almost all internet service in the us has a wifi gateway . even if you hook up your computer to the line , like i do to prevent gaming lag , the router will almost always have wifi connectibility anymore . so their requirements aren't unreasonable . 95 % of my phone usage is in my home so that's 95 % of the time i'm not using a cellular signal . first the bad : 1 ) the phones used to suck . they just introduced the moto x and that is 1000 % better than the old motorola defy xt . you have no choice of phone -- you get either the defy xt or the moto x . this isn't as big a deal for me now , because the moto x is very good . before , i was a little on the fence due to the defy xt . that phone is awful . you don't get to bring your own phone . you don't get an iphone . republic is android only . and your only choice is the moto x ( because the defy xt is not worth having ). fortunately , the moto x is great . 2 ) where i am , sprint coverage sucks . i live near a sprint store in dallas . i am only being slightly sarcastic when i say that no sprint phone works within 1 / 2 mile of a sprint store . however good your sprint coverage is , that's how good your cellular coverage will be . not totally republic's fault here . however , my wifi router regularly decides it doesn't want to be a wifi router regularly , and i absolutely can't get sprint coverage right here in one of the densest populated areas of dallas , 1 / 2 a mile from a sprint store . so for me that means a dropped call . sprint is weird like that for me , on road trips nobody beats sprint , but there are dead zones that have remained dead since the 90s -- lemmon avenue beside love field , and the tollway at the galleria . i'm not the only one with this problem . it's been this way since the 1990s . 3 ) handoff between wifi and cellular . at first , this was a huge , enormous problem , almost a deal breaker . i'm surprised republic survived this problem . but they have and while not perfect , it's enormously better - now the calls don't drop very often , or it will get static - y for a couple seconds . 4 ) no customer service number that you can call . email only . i will list this in the cons , but it's actually been a godsend . no more will you sit on the phone for two hours just to get disconnected , or worse , have to talk to somebody who has no concept of the english words they are reading off some piece of paper . there is a wiki like system in place that is maintained more by the users than by republic . when you think of it , the early adopters of republic tend to be gear heads . they are smart , they are passionate about this new technology , and if there is a way it can be broken , they have broken it , documented it , and told republic how to fix it . otherwise you can open a ticket or send an email to republic and it always , always gets answered within a few hours . in the beginning republic was way in over their heads with the customer service end , and there were serious issues with the way customer service was ( not ) being handled . there was a major lack of communication that has now been fixed . the pros : 1 ) the moto x is a great phone . i love it . it's not an iphone . i am not a tech genius . it does exactly what i want and it does it well . it does things that i didn't know i needed . i can no longer live without the digital flashlight , i had no idea . 2 ) twenty dollars a month people . they now have 4g service . they have several service plans . they range from 40 bucks a month for 4g , i think the 4g throttles at 2.5gb per month . this shouldn't be an issue with the automatic wifi . even with the 3g shitty defy xt , if i needed to get online to find something via google maps , i'd look for a wal mart or target or mc donalds and pull into the parking lot . everyone has free wifi these days . so i'm not using the 4g as much as i thought i might . the old plan was 20 bucks unlimited . that included unlimited 3g service from sprint . that plan is still available . once again , i only ever used 3g for looking up a phone number or for google maps . now they have a wifi only plan for 5 bucks a month . if you want a house phone for browsing the internet , playing video games , streaming stuff over wifi , and making internet phone calls , this is for you . but it will never connect to 3g or 4g or any type of cellular . twenty dollars a month for the same thing i paid 45 bucks a month for awful boost mobile or 120 for awful sprint . at the very worst , if it was as shitty as sprint , that shit would be 1 / 6 of the price . and it doesn't get worse than sprint . except for att and tmobile and all the other cellular providers out there -- they are all in collusion / competition to be the worst . so it could only get better , and it does , much better . republic fixed their shit and now they are awesome 99 % of the time and they fuck up and admit it and fix it the other 1 %. sprint is passable 20 % of the time and shit 80 % of the time , and boost is vile 100 % of the time . 3 ) it was in the cons , but i will list it here again . the republic customers tend to be very tech savvy and so pretty much anything you need to know , somebody already has documented it on the republic website . my conclusion : i love republic . the worst case scenario is this : you will have the same shitty cellular service that you used to have . but instead of paying over 120 a month with my corporate discount when i had a palm from sprint , now i pay 20 bucks a month for the exact same thing plus wifi ability . i also never have to worry about talking to some incompetent idiot who doesn't speak english and will get fired if they deviate from some script and actually help you out . i got the new moto x and upgraded to 40 bucks a month for 4g coverage for that one . i'm going to sell the defy xt -- there is a promotion from motorola that is advertised on republic to send in your old defy for a gift card . i think it was 100 bucks at last count . the phones are not subsidized , so you will pay 300 bucks for the moto x but i remember paying that for a subsidized phone from sprint . republic wireless is not perfect . they are still ironing out a lot of things . but the problems aren't showstoppers like they used to be . i'm honestly surprised republic survived the cellular / wifi disaster and the customer service disaster they had in the beginning -- this was over a year ago . but they survived and they listened to the customers , and they learned from their mistakes and they fixed them . they totally turned it around in a matter of months . that is saying a lot in today's corporate culture -- a company that actually listens to its customers and believes that you get rich by offering a superior product for a really great price , instead of destroying the competition and leeching their customer base because they can . republic just feels fresh . i get the impression that the folks who started republic were like these idealistic frontiersmen who got in over their heads quick , but fixed their mistakes quickly enough to survive . that is quite an impressive feat in today's unforgivable tech climate . they are far superior to their competition and they are getting better at it . oh , and twenty dollars a month . that alone is worth putting up with all the stuff i put up with at first -- but not anymore . now it's 40 bucks a month for 4g . and you can change your plan every month -- you can upgrade or downgrade service at any time . i hope this is the future .
it's outside the mainstream , and i do think it's suspect .

i'm just going to cannabalize my answer to / u / bestillandknow_ the germans did attack the maginot line from the rear in the latter part of the invasion of france , and found a very hard time breaching the defenses , despite the line being isolated from reinforcement , and the forces being much better armed than a few units of fallschrimjagers would have been . certainly a coup d'main , with the element of surprise , might have the same sort of success that the assault on the belgian fortifications had , but i don't think it is at all a given . additionally , the build up of forces necessary to move in and hold the objective were the paratroopers to be successful would clue in the french , meaning they would shift their forces and the element of surprise would be lost .

from the / r / ketogains faq : halp ! i'm losing strength / muscle / endurance ! it must be this damned keto diet , its a fad !!! before you jump into conclusions , stop , read the faq , and answer these questions : how long exactly have you been on keto ? full keto adaptation takes around 8 - 12 weeks , so even tough you are seeing results in weight loss , exercise performance suffers at the beginning of the diet . keto on , and you will reap the rewards . how long have you been exercising ( did you exercise before keto , or are you new to exercise ?) this goes along with the first question , if you exercised before keto you will notice a drop of performance . this is temporary . if not , well , you are doing something new . that is how it goes . new exercises , new diet . its natural . keto on . what is your current weight ? bf %? how many calories are you ingesting ? you may be at a too low caloric deficit . when you exercise , calories burned add to your deficit , so if you are feeling weak , eat more . remember to recalculate every 2 - 3 weeks if you are having big weight fluctuations . are you drinking enough water ? supplementing with sodium , potassium , magnesium ? if not , be sure to do so . check the guidelines on this faq . rest / sleep * are you taking off days ? how many ? enough sleep ? how many hours of sleep time are you getting ? your body needs rest . growth / repair hormones are released when you sleep . so be sure to get some quality time or your results and performance will suffer .

not necessarily . everyone potentially has hiv , but we have a responsibility to be judicious with our resources . it's still a relative rare disease , and like all medical problems , we look for things based on what they are a risk for . someone who complains of chest pain who is 30 years old and otherwise healthy doesn't get the full work up that a 55 yr old does who has smoked , has high blood pressure / cholesterol and a family history if heart disease . if we were like house md , we could find everything with unlimited resources to order every test and see what comes back ( the " shotgun " technique ), but lab work is very expensive . when we were later consulted on him for critical care , the infectious disease specialist specifically asked if he has ever had sex with men which he adamantly denied . he said he has had sex with women only , but no new partners for some time . however , his chest ct looked classic for pcp ( an aids defining illness ) so they ran the test anyway . we know people frequently lie , but we work with what we've got .

" edward snowden has caused more harm " depends on what you think of the importance of human live vs the importance of the status quo . if you believe the government should continue what it is doing in secret , then yes edward snowden has caused tremendous damage . if you value that over the lives killed in 9 / 11 and by al queda since then yes snowden has caused more harm . if , like me , you believe that the death of thousands of people is far worse than a damage to american credibility , credibility it squandered itself , then no , snowden is no where close to bin laden and the comparison is not only crass but sickening .

i made the mistake of humoring my pup regarding # 6 . i let her mouth on my hands because i thought it was cute . then she got the idea that it was okay to mangle my fingers . unfortunately , i had to start giving her a tiny thump on the head to remind her to get it together and not turn my hands into hamburger or to chew my pre - schooler up . i tried verbal cues , but to no avail . once she got into a nipping frenzy , there was nothing for it but to chuck her in the kitchen to calm down . sometimes stuffing a bone or chewy in her mouth works , but she often ignores it in favor of the hand that's holding it .

name a single food that we do " know " more than gmos . gmos being genetically consistent have actually been studied and understood far better than other foods . plus with all the fears they have been researched more as well . i believe that tomatoes cause cancer . the same people that eat tomatoes often get cancer . we have never done sufficient long - term studies to prove that tomatoes don't cause cancer . i don't want to take that risk . what if the cancer - causing aspects of tomatoes are so subtle that you can't easily detect them ? people in england used to believe that tomatoes were poisonous . what if those people were right ? there is no way to ever be 100000 % certain about something like this , but if hundreds of millions of people eat gmo for years and there are no detectable issues then i think they're probably safe enough .

did you steal that joke from the repost ?
it's from tim and eric awesome show , great job !
i thought the premise was interesting , and some of the scenes ( like the isis scene ) were very , very good . but i thought the ending was anticlimactic and the book involved a lot of long scenes of driving around , maybe i didn't really get it .
we'll start with egg or king aegon iv . his son jaehaerys became king . jaehaerys's was mad king aerys father . areys is dany's father . aegon's daughter rhaelle married a baratheon . they had a child named steffon . steffon is robert and stannis's father . it also means that egg is bobby b's great grandfather .
they were called that . however , i'm pretty sure they changed the name to " socker " to make it more kid - friendly . i guess the phrase " sock ' em " gave too much of a negative connotation in regards to violence .
you don't like the dreads ? they won me over in the first place when i started watching mls .
shaving anything . it's my small part for equality . why do i have to shave , pluck , wax all of my body hair when men don't ? why is it unacceptable for men to do that ? i prefer my forests to the unbearable itching and ingrown hair . sure , i sometimes trim areas , but that's purely for my own comfort .
i was enjoying thinking it's a ringworm . to compromise i shall content myself to think it a ringworm earring , which is even better .
mrw to the ending was :'-) mrw to having no more chuck was :'-/
the drive from most parts of phoenix to the arena is not all that long . shorter than the skytrain from king george to stadium unless there is rush hour .
iirc , this is done with a string tied to a tooth or something ridiculous like that .
someone has definitely sneakily stolen some of my life in the meantime , coz it definitely doesn't feel that long ago reddit . reddit owns you now
take what shes doing into mind . because everything she did to them , she will do to you .
i have a dozen or two uk garage discs form the early oughts , but didn't know it was experiencing a resurgence . one aspect of the original post i find interesting is that popularity is described as a factor that caused the implosion of the form . this is a common theme in most genres of dance music from the birth of disco the present . i wonder if this pattern gives migraines to the suits working at record labels . once a dance form is taken from the underground clubs and underground labels into the radio stations and major labels , the end is nigh . i suppose that the record label execs can then just find the next big thing , blow it up , ruin it , and move on . the people who are at ground zero for any given dance genre are probably frustrated by this process , however . to have " your " music stolen by major labels , transformed into something alien , and then ultimately turned into garbage . some pioneers get in on the popularization movement ( and fall with it ). others chose to stay consistently poor rather than risk the cash - followed - by - crash -&- irrelevance cycle that comes with dance music popularization .

how was your day , otter_elemental ?
your time is here
the faceless men know that the supposed no one is , at her heart , arya stark . when they point this out to her , she tries to lie and says she's left that identity behind . they see through her , though , and her lies , and as long as clings to her true self , they won't send her off to kill anyone she knew in that life . period .
the humanist in me says yes . we should make all holidays for all religion . however , the realist in me says that make holidays for religion that significant adherents . no point in making a national holiday when few dozens people follow a religion in a country of 64 millions of people . hindu and sikh probably have a large presence in uk . it would only make sense to have a holiday for them . buddhists ? not sure . do they even have holidays ? what's their % in uk ?

[ please read .] ( reading your comment history , i find this discussion pointless . you are a conspiracy theorist , and that makes you devoid of rational thinking . so have a nice day .
no way no way i think you need a new one
they are the first group that comes to mind when i think of mathematical music . some of it is a bit too much and sounds like a bunch of random number generators duking it out but when it works it's great . fold4 , wrap5 is one of my favourites . it gives the sensation of constantly slowing .
i'm with you , fellow landlocked coast guardian .
they still have to add in the laugh track because there is no way an audience erupts with laughter every time sheldo says " zimbabwe ".
if only decoud could tackle and take the correct angles to break up passes as well as he could dance .....
i agree . not to mention how good of a defender kobe was in his prime . he was an elite defender . for op to say that they had similar defensive output is just plain wrong .
i'm sure his parents love him no matter what he looks like .
his handles apparently came out very fortunate ...
i'm not sure i caught any of that ...
the problem is that it's still saying the same thing as " the media reports a lot about black people committing crimes , so i don't feel anger about how people express their fear of black people and how they refuse to be out at night because of black people , just sadness ." sadness is fine , but in any context other than this one , you'd be livid as hell .
most expensive apartments consider these little bargains up on the peak ; at 800 million or over 12kusd / sqft it's practically being given away , or how about 13.8kusd / sqft from the selfless mr li instead ? and remember steven chow once bought a building up there for 300 million which is now worth over a billion - truly hilarious .

depending on the nutritional value , in most cases , don't spend more than 1.99 a lb on fruits or veggies . eat local if you can afford it and what's in season . and don't forget frozen fruits and veggies . always pay attention to how much it costs per oz . it's almost always in small print on the tags in the grocery stores . if you want meat , you can purchase a whole chicken from the butcher , and have him or her cut it in into 8 pieces ( usually for free ) and de - bone the breast . i get organic , air chilled chicken only , as all others are soaked in water before being frozen , thus you are paying for water weight , not tasty chicken . sometimes this is only 1.99 a lb @ my local whole foods . usually 2.99 a lb , and i only eat meat maybe but 3 to 4 times a week . my cheap and healthy standbys are : rice ( spice it up with a bit of cilantro ) potatoes ( good carbs , vitamin c , potassium , very good with green onion ) oranges ( vitamin c ) bananas ( vitamin b - 6 , c , potassium ) kale , chard , or mustard greens ( vitamin a , vitamin c ) bell peppers and corn ( when in season are super cheap ) baby carrots ( vitamin a ) red onion and garlic ( essential for tasty food ) eggs ( recommend cage free ) i'll make chicken with diced and baked potatoes , get some thyme or green onion and fresh ground pepper on those potatoes , and either saute some kale / chard with garlic , or make a salad with dark greens ( no iceberg ). some red onion , olive . if you're feeling really cheap , get some super cheap corn tortillas , lightly fry each side in olive oil until brown . get some beans ( dried are probably healthiest ), pickled vegetables ( found in the hispanic foods section or market ), chopped greens like spinach or mustard greens , sour cream if desired , and whatever else you want . i like to go straight to the produce department when i shop , and try to fill my basket up 80 % there , this is key . then meat or tofu , and then maybe some pasta or udon noodles from the grocery isles . sorry this was so long . i hope someone actually reads it . you really can eat cheap and healthy , you just have to pay a little more attention to cost per oz .
why does something that a twisted , criminal individual does have any relation to people who fought for racial equality ? the assumption is that this person casts a shadow on their fight and the only way he's doing that is by representing their race . edit : phone grammar

ha , me too . but in fairness , it's because he goes to bed later than i do so it's generally dry by the time he gets to bed .

hey everyone . i just felt saying that i got 78.50 ( i think ) which was way below what i was hoping for . so that ruled out vet science for me ( which is different now ) but i spoke to the vet faculty office and was able to fill out a form for a few extra points . the system works a little differently these days but i still highly recommend you talk to as many people as you can about your options . there is no one who is out to stop you from doing what you want ( family pressure aside , but that's a different slice of cake ). moral of my story : atar isn't everything
i doubt it , like i said there are way too many pieces pointing towards his innocence and i doubt kurt is that predictable
great article , thanks for posting !

if you haven't found a specific place yet , try to find one where grande is available . they are awesome - in the sense that they are a good company with employees who don't hate their job / employer . their actual service is about on par with others . i have always had good response from their repair people - the truck rolls are always grande employees and not contractors . their cs people are in austin / san marcos . i have friends who have been working there over a decade and still love it . as far as grande service , they offer 100mbit now that their docsis3 infrastructure is deployed . their digital cable service is equivalent to tw last i checked . uverse is better as far as cable imo , but for internet service and not being a giant shitty corporation grande wins by a long shot . i have used them for 10 years and feel lucky that i actually have the option of using a local ( ish ) isp in this day and age . to check if you can get them at a particular address , go here and click the " check service availability " button at the top .

agreed . the leather , lining , and stitching look to be poor quality . the laces are pretty tacky but that's a quick fix . maybe worth 120 , but definitely not 170 . there's a store in sf called azalea that's selling similar boots for 100 . forget the brand name . maybe it'll come to me . not to shit on op . he got what he wanted at a price he was comfortable with and that's all that really matters . / soapbox
it seems i'll have to recruit even more anteaters to aid in my cause then ...
as somebody who has been reading scientific papers on mdma , i hope that you realise that your anecdotal evidence is just that , your own evidence . do you have any rationale for your course of action ? 50 - 80mg per day for a month straight seems a little nuts to me . but if it worked for you it worked . i had also consumed 3 joints per day as a countermeasure to any neurological damage that may occur . this sentence was a serious wtf for me , because cannabis affects the brain , and not necessarily positively . some cannabinoids are neuroprotective sure , but thc certainly isn't . where is this rationale , or idea coming from ? there certainly isn't any solid scientific evidence that mdma is more harmful for your brain than cannabis as far as i know . well anyway , i'm glad this worked for you . but it may just be for you . if i was to go on a 50mg course of mdma for a month solid , i'm pretty sure i'd go from not - depressed to depressed for a few months as i know how i am after seratonin depletion . perhaps as somebody who was chronically depressed before your serotonin balance was off kilter and this repaired it ? or that this is just placebo ? who knows . interesting though . please post scientific / medical paper links that give a basis for your approach . ps : sorry if i sound a little dubious but i want this subreddit to advocate safe use of mdma . thus far safe use is usually regarded as doses spread with months in between .

haha the mug is almost falling off the table !
mine was actually a result of a head injury , it is very rare that that happens so i'm very glad your friend doesn't suffer them anymore . it can kill somebody to completely take them off their meds if their doses are too high .

florida is a stop and identify state . i believe the card would cover you as identifying yourself .
it's encouraging pedophilia , and it would be near impossible to determine whether the children were coerced by anyone . it would also be a ridiculous head ache for investigators to track down every single picture and make sure it came from the person themselves . society also has a right to say that , in general , pedophillic images hurt society itself and should be banned .
ready for them singular values ?
you're a sick freak and should be beaten .
awesome ... awesome to the max
i'm sorry but this is disgusting wtf did joe say to the in the locker room how can an offensive line be so bad and how can the cooridinator run the same fucking plays its obviously not working .
do all these girls know about each other ? do any of them think they are the only one you are talking to ? breaking a rut is not an excuse to be an asshole .
i was going to say the same thing . jesus had always been represented in europe as a european . anyone thinking that the nazis made up " blonde , blue - eyed jesus " has never seen a renaissance painting . footnote : jesus was not portrayed as a european for any racial or ideological reasons . europeans , like most people of the world at the time , were born , lived and died in the same town . most people never traveled farther than 50 miles from their birthplace . thus europeans had no idea what , say , chinese people looked like . or saudi arabians . or eskimos . they could only interpret the world through their own lens . so jesus came out looking european when portrayed by europeans . ( in asia , the opposite thing happened to buddha . though the chinese turned him into an asian , the historical buddha was described as " thin , tall and blue - eyed ". the tribe he was from in northern india were related to the scythians in central asia . ( according to herodotus , these central asian horsemen were redheaded and blue - eyed .) recently mummies in western china were dug up . they had red and blonde hair , and european dna and features . they were the tocharians . they're credited with introducing the horse and buddhism to china . my point in this ? the historical buddha was a part of this ethnological group . he did not look like an obese asian , as he's so often portrayed today .) so though everyone loves busting on " german jesus " no one ever thinks to bust on chinese buddha . " well , he's been portrayed as a chinaman for centuries . it must be true !") except it's not . unlike most founders of religions , we actually have physical descriptions of buddha . by the way , here are some pics of people in buddha's neck of the woods , who still look like the older type ( that buddha was a part of ). behold , a hunza girl from the himalayas : or this kalash girl from what would have been northern india in guatama's day : or this man from the same area : here's a pic of a redheaded , blue - eyed tocharian mummy from the same area ( who had dna associated with modern poles , hungarians and ossetians ): ( her group pre - dated asians in the area by thousands of years . she was 6 ' tall .) moral of the story : in descriptions of buddha as " tall , thin and blue - eyed ," they weren't exaggerating . we have skeletons from the area who confirm that this is what the original populace looked like . as well as living descendants ( with the same dna ) in the area . but since buddhism took off in china , the chinese started portraying buddha as one of their own . exactly like with christianity . since it took off in europe , the tendency was to re - make a middle easterner into a european .
cool ain't it . sadly just about everyone i know still thinks chicken is pumped to the eyes with growth hormones .
you should be able to run source games on low settings . portal , portal 2 , team fortress 2 , left for dead 2 , counter strike source etc .
come on there must be some way you guys can crack down on anonymous hoax calls or every teenager would be at it day and night . something about this case must have been special for you to be dispatched .
well , on average , the mass transplants that leave for nh tend to be more conservative than their nh brethren they now live among ( bill gardner told me that years ago , he had data , i'll believe him ), so this is quite probably true .
i dislike the idea that your bonus is tied to the profitability of the entire company . you work hard all year , really put yourself out there and have the best year of your career . well sorry , our sales department lost a few deals and it didn't work out so there is no bonus for you . this seems wrong to me . bonuses should be based on your delivery and tied to your personal performance and should have nothing to do with the overall company that you can't influence at all .
he's trolling . aint the little thing cute ?
yes , basically it outputs the most basic attack damage through basic attacks and doesn't buy many defense items . most people wont even have a clue what that is till like level 20 . top for the most part is a bruiser or tank that buys a lot of defensive items . mid generally is the apc ( ability power carry ) unless you decide to go assassin or some form of ad . the assassins are nerfed pretty hard right now other than talon . i find mid to be one of the more fun roles if you can get it , people tend to want to play that . starting out jungle is the hardest as with no runes or masteries it is basically impossible . you unlock just about 1 rune and mastery slot per level . support right now is very strong and basically you help the adc stay alive . also dont buy any skins for now as you may end up never using that champ . once you hit level 30 i suggest not wasting ip on champs as that is what you use to buy runes . at early stages runes are expensive and annoying to save up for .
on the same kind of note , i also remember seeing something about adam smith , who often gets brought up by libertarians , supporting the government's role in providing infrastructure for commerce .
i felt dirty cheering , but that hazard goal was beautiful .
and this the hijackers , said to be from the abu nidal organisation , were captured by pakistan , tried , convicted and sentenced to death in 1988 . their sentences were later commuted to life in prison . in 2001 , zayd hassan abd al - latif masud al safarini , the hijacker who shot the passengers , was captured by the fbi in bangkok after being released by pakistan . in the us , he is presently serving 160 years prison term in colorado . four others were freed from pakistan's adyala jail in january 2008 . the fbi announced a 5 million bounty on their head .
didn't make it , just did some digging and found it online .
i think about what my best qualities are and focus on them . everyone has something they're good at , figure what that is , and work on it . we are all great people and its natural to get down , but just remember there are better times to come . and love yourself !
that game was the falcons season in a nutshell .
this is a great answer , and i really agree with it . i can't see the bbc doing a gender change simply because brand recognition is huge , but a non - white guy would be really really cool . as long as he had a british accent . the lack of accent would seriously through me off every time he spoke . but yeah , get the right actress and writers , and you got yourself an awesome doctor . we'll wait and see where it goes .
it will be my first game too . have you heard any tips other than dress warm ? i plan on bringing plenty of beer . hopefully , i can barter for some bbq with it .
he is fairly light . i'm positive if it's ever really windy in manchester he has to stay indoors
a lot of players are seen as soft and they don't get randomly punched in the throat
maybe i'm just good with words ? nah that aint it .
i don't know of any game company which promotes games of competitors in any major way . riot will ofc promote their own game first and foremost when it comes to e - sports . although , one would be naive to not see positive effects of lol being popular and introducing new spectators to the world of e - sports . most spectators are not as brainwashed to think there are no other competitive computer games . i bet there are several people who started spectating lol - tournaments and moved on to other games and experiences .
everyone will remembaaah the turtyfurst of decembaaah
yeah , it was very telling how a lot of people reacted when the pope said our societies are doing a bad job at fairly distributing wealth . if the idea of sharing makes you angry , fuck you , you have terrible morals .
huh i presumed it was to be honeydew not simon himself .
is watt really having a potential dpoy season ? or is that more recognition of his name more than anything else ?
