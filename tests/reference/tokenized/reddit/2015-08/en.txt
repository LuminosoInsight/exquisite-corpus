most people i know are on less than that before tax . there's a loads of people on low wages . you live in a house share , you don't run a car , you eat and live frugally .
this response seems to make the most sense ... part of my fear is that the spider moves so quickly and can easily go out of sight ( or jump in my face ..).. which only increases the anxiety i feel ... nothing worse than knowing a huge spider is somewhere in your house but not knowing where the fuck it is .
holy shit , that's clean . i've been looking for someone with this sort of skill actually ( polishing and whatnot ), if i could grab your attention on a project i've had in mind , i hope interests you . hit me up on pm if you can .
bring back ness and falco's old d - airs
yeah , why would someone choose to be depressed for a long time ? it consumes you . someone can attentionwhore for a while but those attentionwhores wouldn't go into actual depression by choice . ( they can , though ) thing is , with betrayal and emotional manipulation , you don't know it's happening until it's too late and the effects are ingrained in you . some people simply are not equipped with tools and experience to know what's happening and deal with it . ( replied this to someone else but posting it here as well )
on offense , qb brad kaaya . he was thrown into the fire last year , starting all 13 games as a true freshman and managed to put up some solid numbers ( 3,198 pass yds and 26 tds , which i believe is more passing tds than any other true freshman qb in the past decade ). now , with a year of experience he should be even better . reports from spring and summer have indicated that kaaya has a much better understanding of the playbook and has really taken on the role of leader / commander for the entire offense . while the team did lose some key offensive skill players last year , there is still plenty of talent for kaaya to work with and as long as the offensive line can give kaaya some time , he should be able to utilize all of those weapons . on defense , i think it's a toss up between s deon bush and olb jermaine grace . bush is an incredibly talented s that has shown improvement in each season at miami . he is a hard hitter with a nose for the football and has decent ball skills in coverage as well . bush has been a bit injury prone during his career but if he manages to stay healthy he could have a really special season . grace is a bit more uncertain as he has never started a game at miami . that said , he is primed for a breakout season . last year , with limited snaps , he managed to put up 60 tackles , 6.5 tfls , 3 sacks and 2 fumble recoveries . he is one of the fastest players on the team , clocking a 4.38 40 time during spring testing and has great instincts at lb , always finding the ball . at 215 lbs , he is a bit undersized for his position but he still manages to pack some punch . with the help of an improved dl he could easily go for 100 tackles this season and has the athleticism to make some highlight reel plays .
i think at this point , trying to nail down a pattern is dubious at best . there isn't one . and you're forgetting that mop had a race and a class . that said , i would really love to see new races or a new class , just something new to play with . i'm not even overly picky about what it is . i will say , though , that no matter what the fanboys say , i think high elves would be a poor choice - there's not enough difference from blood elves to make them interesting .
i don't see rust on the tops of the tracks , they don't seem to be abandoned but it's difficult to tell .

what is the deal with mobile bandwidth ? why is it so expensive , to the point a family plan in at & t actually shares 10 gigs across four lines ? is there a technical limitation ? it's not a technical issue , but a political and regulatory issue . mobile internet access isn't nearly as expensive outside the us as it is in the us , mainly because other countries have governments that look out for the people and keep corporations in their place by regulating them to within a millimeter of their lives . the us government cares more about the rich and corporations , and so lets businesses do as they please even if it fucks over everybody else .
that's precisely my point though . masturbation is often synonymous with men , it's seen as something only men do , it's viewed as a male practice . women aren't thought of when it comes to this topic , so they're getting off scott free because women do indeed masturbate , some even more than men , despite the fact they are being overlooked .
guess the " b " is for block .. meaning it will reveal all buttons right next to it . no actual item afaik
and you pay for something and your change gets thrown on the counter . random car stops from the police hoping you don't have license , registration , and insurance , because " haole ".
if i'm not mistaken , getting in the top 7 will guarantee she wouldn't have to play serena until the sf . does that sound right ? if so , she's 1404 points out of 7th . she'll need great showings this week and in cincinnati , but she looks capable .
you can sublimate into a group mind or have your personality as the basis but as far as i can tell direct mindhood - dom ?- isn't available . and , honestly , it's a relief . who wants jimmy from accounts running an orbital ?
this guy has actual experience in network programming . that's why this particular mod made such impressive gains because its actually done by someone who knows exactly what's he getting into .

well uh , i guess so ? even if i wanted , good luck , trying to get down on her , while her mother is in the next room haha . but seriously not every relationship between male and female has to be sexual , right ?
it's quieter than a car with the windows down . actually it's quieter than most car engines .
i don't see the big problem with being a kid again . just more time to train and get stronger .
very few integrated schools . the state ones are meant to be but the whole place segregates itself . protestants head to state schools while catholics head to catholic schools . edit : i should mention that there's no real motive for politicans to encourage integrated education since they get voted in based on stirring up old shit and keeping people divided . you may think " why don't catholics go to state schools " but the old unionist government didn't do much to make these schools friendly , essentially trying to delete every bit of irishness from the curriculum and teaching an essentially british worldview on things .
not sure why he didn't just use the brake instead of his foot .
i have to say i found that video pretty cringy . maybe because i'm not mtf , i can't really identify with it .. i guess their hearts were in the right place , at least they were showing support . but geez is it painful to watch . seems extremely strange that her first time ( i presume ) dressing as a girl , she puts on slutty clothes and goes to a bar . who does that ? those guys with the tied off flannel shirts were awesome tho , shoulda just done a whole video of them .
xt is not an altcoin . xt offers you a choice if you choose to switch your node and / or miner over to xt , and if 75 % of miners do too then the bitcoin protocol will switch to a protocol that can support 8mb blocks in 2016 . if the 75 % of support is not achieved , then bitcoin xt will work with the bitcoin core nodes to support the same network .
you're very wrong . rampage is a beast in pvp . banner turns team fights instantly . the signet is just great fit self buffing if you aren't comfortable with rampage . the norn firms all pale in comparison .
yeah , i hear ya . it's not a clear cut thing by any means . the synths said they had to learn pretty such everything from scratch . i guess the basic code might include things like how to walk and move their hands and arms . maybe even a basic understanding of english . probably not personality or whatever , though .
at least kinda sexist , yeah .
agreed . bethany framing charles was something we learned in the finale , so it could have been molded into something that made sense for that plot , i guess .
effective out to something like 700m against gophers ...
it was definitely the headlights on the 996 that didn't do it for me
please , please , please ... they had to go out of their way to dress the same . even the haircuts are kind of right . i can't imagine what the conversation would have sounded like if this isn't satire . how would they prep each other for this ??
man i'm surprised sudfeld isn't being talked about . he was literally gronk
harry's constantly changing patronus and sirius's head in the fire would like to support your point .
is that even a fight tough ?
here are my problems with the movie . mary jane is written so poorly written . she's so selfish and unappealing in this movie , she doesn't communicate her feelings clearly and just acts like a bitch . and her plotline is so contrived , she was headlining major plays now she can only get job as a singing waitress ? what about the dumbest retcon in history . we had to dredge up uncle ben again . and for what ? so we can shove in a message about forgiveness that is not earned at all . also , harry's amnesia , do you remember how stupid , cliche and trite that was ? it's bad soap opera worthy . then to have the butler withhold crucial information for plot convenience is also pretty dumb . his entire plotline could have been solved so quickly . eddie brock praying to god to kill peter parker . then it also happens that peter is in the same church wrestling with the symbiote at the same time just so we can have the symbiote drip down and attack eddie which turns him into venom . god , the conveniences is too obvious it's almost like lazy writing . then we get mary jane kidnapped again and suspended in a high place again . we've had this happen in 2 movies already , just like harking back to uncle ben . it's just stale and hokey . i haven't seen the movie since its release and those are what annoyed me even when i was a dumb kid , now i'm a dumb adult and still disappointed with what it could have been .
so the real question is this : do you believe that bernie sanders can garner as much popularity as barrack obama to win the democratic nomination from hilary ?
nice one on brendan gaughan !
what i've always been warned is not to start a fwb relationship with the hope that it'll turn into something more romantic , because that way lies madness . fwb is fine , but not when one person is secretly hoping / planning for it to become something more .

don't shoot the messenger mate . here's another source for you . regardless of the nationality of those who stopped him , they were incredibly courageous .
he's more daring him to do it in front of him . clearly he has hit her in the past , and the son is saying , " do it again and see what happens ."
he was already dead , he just didn't know it yet . kind of spooky if you think about it . still trying to fight your enemy as a ghost , not willing to succumb to death yet , the enemy must die first .
it's gonna come across as demanding because you're assuming this lady's gonna even want to sleep with you at all . because she " isn't a virgin " and " was pretty freaky ". yikes dude .

5 easy pieces came out 20 years ago , in 1995 . not 25 years ago in 1990 so , he was rewarding himself 5 years before the film came out , after he had only had made 2 short films ? his first film wasn't until 1993 , 3 year after he came to you celebrating when he was still a nobody film - maker ? just admit it , you fucked up saying steve mcqueen and 25 years , not knowing that he died before that and are now backtracking . some of it was pretty believable though , but no proof of your shop with photos , a new account , no proof the shop even exists ... poor effort overall , sir .

what made him a ineffective 4th liner ? he's not out there to score goals , he's out there to grind out 30 - 45 seconds of time , hit some motherfuckers , and provide a thorntonesque role in the locker room .
don't forget a weird reversal and pin system that ruins it for those who want to tell a story in matches . prowrestling in games shouldn't be all strategy and securing a pin asap for all players .
the depressing bit just doesn't even fit with the tinge of whimsical playfulness that the fallout series has always had honestly , i thought it made for a really great juxtaposition . in fallout 3 , the world looked like absolute shit everywhere you went , but the tone of the game ( as i played it , anyway ) along with the music and the retro - futuristic design in general all made for a very goofy , fun experience most of the time , broken up occasionally by the main storyline . i recognize that it's a personal preference , but i love the disconnect between the ultra - depressing environment and the elements that kind of prohibit you from taking things too seriously . regarding to article , i'm very interested in the idea of a society that has spent decades successfully rebuilding after an apocalyptic event , but that's not really what i'm looking for in a fallout game .
people will blindly follow that bullshit after being radicalized thanks for the dehumanisation people really believes that once they are free from the reigns of spain , there will be no corruption and that everyone in cataluña is free of sin no , what we believe is that after independence we'll have to set up a new justice and tax system from scratch . and then , after analysing the shortcomings of the current ones , comparing them with those of other countries , and a ton of pressure from civic organisations we might get ones that reduce the amount of corruption that is currently present in our society .
what bothers me is that it will catch people's eye even when you're on break . i get a full 1.5 hours of break / lunch time every day , but apparently if i'm sitting at my desk i must be seen working at all times .
you have a point , but i think op was referring to how influential they proved to be in the pop soundscape . echoes of their bubbly synthpop were immediately noticeable in releases that came after them . an extreme example is owl city , who copied their style wholesale ( with , in my opinion , awful results )
how to fix this .
happened in the town i grew up in . i never ate there and thank god .
i know brick oven pizza is constantly blaring fox news all day . not the best atmosphere , but it would work .
also , make sure your games don't update using p2p software . i got two strikes for updating war thunder using p2p . got kicked off the internet for three days , and i had to explain to someone why i was doing " peer to peer networking ."

“ what’s the status of ember - data ?” holy fuck they still haven't finish this ? i was on beta 5 to 7 that was like what ? over two years ago . i was more on the angularjs bandwagon but the lead dev pull a fast one so we were all force to use emberjs . emerjs was horrible in term of breakage every beta version breaks and then every version breaks too ! they mind as well just label it as alpha . my experience with it wasn't so great but it was pretty straight forward in concepts . angularjs has more stuff to learn with scoping and tranculusion whatever word . that was my career turning point in term of not going to do front end anymore . i haven't done anything real front end stuff like ember or angular since then . other than jquery and requirejs . edit : i'm going to wait for 5 years and then let darwin do it's thing to decide who win . like jquery being one of the defacto library .
true . my mistake .

the elf " ivelio " started out as a perfectly competent gunslinger , but realized that he had other talents that were significantly less likely to leave him dead in an alley . which is why he's better known as the guy who wrote approximately 8 zillion really bad novels about shadowrunners , many focusing on street sammy bret " viper " stark . these books are the height of " pink mohawk " storytelling - bret actually has one - and treating them as guidebooks is a great way to get dead . inexplicably , they are also really popular with actual shadowrunners , many of whom read his stuff as kids . some common shadowrun " slang " was invented by him and put in circulation by his fans . i'll let you guess which ones . when a newsmagazine called him out for exaggerating his street cred , he decided to return to the shadows and write a serious non - fiction book about the life . he's thirty years out - of - date on a lot of things , but hie reflexes are still good , and ( thanks to royalties ) his gear is top - notch .
whereas everything else you read on reddit about tpp is very balanced , this video being a perfect example . even if it is biased , it's nice to read some balancing views to make up your own mind
i think i agree , you would have been better off . i know i would have been better off .
it's only the dankest meme
your problem is that you tried to apply combat rules to a dramatic scene . simply narrate based on the pcs ' descriptions of their actions . if they move too close to the villain , simply say " as you step forward , the bad guy squeezes the trigger and executes the villager ." the combat rules , action economy , initiative order , hit points , etcetera are all abstractions meant to make fight scenes where the outcome is uncertain easier to manage in a fair way . in scenes where the outcome is certain , i.e . this villain is going to kill this villager and nothing the pcs can do will prevent it , then simply ignore the rules and say so . don't feel like you have to justify it .

if you can get to ne / central you can visit bauhaus , fair state ( next to a german bakery so they often have soft pretzels for sale too !), 612 & indeed .
that is a huge red flag . this guy has some major issues / insecurities and is completely unwilling to work on them . he's being immature and emotionally manipulative the way he is always trying to turn things around and make it seem like you don't love him when you bring up things that are issues for you . you are unhappy and he refuses to even talk about it . this isn't healthy and you don't deserve to be treated that way . i think you know what you need to do .
you gave it to her , as far as i know , it is her property now .
something additional we can discuss here : there were a few recent sufu posts criticizing how things operate here ( starting toward the bottom of the linked page ). we don't need to address every single remark written there , but it's not a bad idea to get others ' points of view on this community . i get that there's a bit of a demographical difference between us and them and that's fine . some of the users there see us as something like paranoid beginners who make stupid , meaningless posts . personally , i don't mind so much . if we're the kids table and they're the adults table , so be it . being welcoming can't really be viewed negatively in my eyes . we watch new users develop their views , style , and denim all the time , and i think it's pretty cool to see .
i rent my car from a team that runs 3 cars . rental cost 1000 a weekend . testing the day before costs 100 - 200 to the circuit and entry fee for the race ( s ) costs 195 . so it adds up quickly enough . luckily for me , the series in ireland runs a race especially for guys in their first and second years ( the b and c championships ). this allows less experienced drivers to get an extra race at no extra cost . we are very fortunate to have this . then we all race together in the a race later in the day and that is its own separate championship . you are doing the right thing by testing a car , however it can be a lot to take in and the god honest truth is you could be shit on your first go . don't let that put you off - it can take a bit of time to get used to a race car if you've no reference . i was terrible in my first drive in a single seater but then over time i improved very quickly . i don't know much about vees in the uk only they run different gears and tyres to the irish series , but i would definitely go down that route instead of straight into fords or something . it's the best way to learn and probably a quarter of the cost . racing is fantastic as well - it's definitely the best decision i made in a long time . good luck !
whatever you say , dork .
you'd have to clear out the homeless person smell first ... and by that i mean crap . there'd be a lot of structural work to do too , but it is a damn nice spot !
mark twain is funny and insightful . i could see him being like louis ck , just talking about everyday shit with great delivery and unexpected twists
that or they " got theirs " and don't give a crap about everyone else who struggles . go to college , they say . do these people honestly think there's enough jobs floating around for everyone to go college and make 70k ? no , the world needs min wage workers . trouble is ... that min wage isn't keeping pace with inflation .
the way he smashed the interpreter guy's head to the wall with all that blood . i mean now his tranlations may be a little weird sometimes .
they want to " optimize " game . but this isn't optimization , it's cutting game of features . in that way i could remove files of fog , snow or any other particles because they " slow me down ".
he's making progress . if he can maximize his obvious physical talent along with the mental aspects of the game , he could really become a top - 5 candidate for cbs .
firstly i'd get away from large population areas , proceed to take with me as much food as possible and weapons . if i run out i'll raid local areas for supplies . in reality i'd probably die very quickly like the majority .
kind of a shitty thing to do tbh :/

well , catholicism is hierarchical , so i'm just going to accept the explanation .
i wouldn't even be mad tbh
i'd say get it on pc , the playerbase there will probably last longer . also you won't have to pay for ps . just be sure to plug in a controller , the keyboard controls will probably suck again .
also ask if they've ever had shrimp , and say they eat suuuuuper tiny tiny things like that , and explain how they get them to their mouthbutts .
on paint use the free form select tool to outline the face or whatever , then hold shift and click and drag the face around , and it does that . unless you mean actually stretching your face , then i can't help you .

sure is ! f7c - r hornet tracker .
best episode of the season so far ? great all around and i enjoyed the humor in the beginning . i also didn't feel like this episode had much ( or any ) fat , so to speak . fuck yeah helen and betty tessa is still such a little shit . i was hoping that the tie thing would backfire on her . oh well . did giny's dad lie to her ? it seems in - character of giny's mom to have entered giny in the beauty pageant . barton and margaret is always yes . i love how civil barton is . he still loves her and wants her to be happy , even if it's not with him ( beginning of the episode ). still a sucker for the contrast of giny and libby . virginia's eyes were practically shining as bill gave his monologue , while libby's face kind of dropped immediately . bill finally opens up a little to libby and she doesn't really respond to him . unhinged bill is always fun to watch . he's just blowing up at this kid and once he's done , he's just so confused / a little guilty / lost . superb acting from the cast , as always . :) edit person who currently reviews mos for avclub will be no longer . hmm .
i'm going to imagine she handed over a 10 and after refusing change , she held up a clinched fist and whispered .." keep pounding " with sunglasses on .... and followed by a quick " weeeooowweeoow " growl . yes . that is how it happened . you have an awesome wife .
seems unlikely to happen imho
what is a negative index ? what is a negative count ? twos - complement is irrelevant . who cares how ' signed ' integers are stored when they are illogical for the problem at hand . why would you want that behavior for something you are never going to use ? additionally the storage of signed integers is implementation defined . it is never guaranteed to be two's complement .

although true , it's really more that non - asians are pussies when it comes to driving
i'm fairly insecure about a lot of things , but i think what sticks out the most is not anything physical . i'm always insecure about not being " good enough ." it's weird and hard to explain . but i'm sure someone out there knows the feeling .
it's no a good idea to put someone like that in charge of a business , but the idea for the business itself might be a very good idea . if she can be induced to let someone else general manage ( have control of hiring / firing , financing , and day to day operations ) then she might actually see this set up . but without details it's impossible to tell . still , if she sets it up as a business ( llc , llp , s corp , c corp , ect ) then personal assets not explicitly signed over would be protected in the event of the business failing . i would definitely make sure that she doesn't try to do this as a person or a sole proprietorship , because in that case individual and martial assets would be at risk . you need to get involved now . you need to get in contact with those people who may have received promises and let them know about the totality of the situation . if there are people that the both of you trust then maybe getting them involved here would be a good idea . if she is making promises that she can't keep and committing to debts that she cannot pay then that's going to be a serious problem , but if you can get her in a box ( a corporate one should she be able to function as a reasonable person , or a conservatorship if she cannot ).
what the fuck pro game drafts champs then picks its roster ?
i was able to drop 10k to pay off part of my worst student loans this year by using some savings , getting a sum of money from a relative that passed , and a promotion bonus . i had so much anxiety from dropping that much money even on something smart . i grew up poor as crap . spending over 25 gives me anxiety . buying plane tickets gives me anxiety . spending over 8 on a meal out gives me anxiety . all of this even though my husband and i are in a good place financially . but i am getting better ; i just dont want to forget where i came from . i dont want to have the same debt my parents had . hell i want to help them pay it once i dig out of my student loan pit . my husband grew up exceptionally rich until his family went broke in the recession . aside from being very blase about how he got to travel internationally all the time as a kid ( while i never did ), he is usually good . lol , except for being surprised that i am hesitant when once or twice a year when he wants to drop few hundred dollars on his hobby .

i used to hate james's camo crocs , but now i find them so endearing .
heh , i didn't mean to sound prejudiced . dark skinned people still look more normal , as they become darker and not pale - grey , like caucasians .
those articles are really important to be able to raise awareness about the issues that women face and are considered " normal ". you were able to do something about being raped ? that's good , and i'm happy you were able to do so , but unfortunately not all women get that opportunity . in fact , the majority don't , because there's always the assumption that she did something to provoke the rapist , or that she is lying , or some other bullshit like that . a lot of women have to endure the pain alone because nobody believes them . i think it's very rude of you to assume that everyone is able to do something about their situation . when you get called a liar , a slut , when what happened to you gets brushed off as a joke , you just feel discouraged , and it's extremely hard to make progress when everyone is belittling you .
the day the earth was teabagged . wetly .
you're free to dress your troops as an enemy as long as they don't participate in combat . but how you deal with such troops if they're captured isn't exactly " regulated "... as a sidenote , kinda shitty that the separatists are doing this .
i've always imagined something like the blues ... the whole ' low - tech ' aspect comes out with a grungy guitar . i imagine a guy sitting on the sidewalk , playing a cheap beat - up guiitar , plugged directly into a laptop on a folding card table , mixing tracks on the fly and singing along . techno , honestly , sounds like it's trying to hard to be the future . it just doesn't do it for me in a cyberpunk vibe sort of way . i feel more of a cyberpunk kick whenever there's a blues punk that mentions a more modern cause of trouble .
her response to your valid concern ? " shut the fuck up ." i don't think seatbelts are the only problem in your relationship .
bb8 according to preseason
yeah going into a prussia game if you don't know that poland will turn on you as soon as you take danzig can be in a bit of a mess . look into maybe declaring war on one of their allies . you may be able to have more of your allies join you in that war . since you only need the one province eating the unjustified demands penalty shouldn't be that bad . if this doesn't appear to be a good option then waiting for a moment of weakness and / or building a relationship with russia might be the answer .
in real life the u.s government would just run to mount weather , raven rock and cheyenne mountain . they'd take delta force and navy seals with them including various marine corps , air force , army and navy personnell . basically they'd be like the bos or enclave in fallout
they have to talk jibberish so you think you're an idiot .
i hope they dont refund you anything .
good luck with the surgery mate , you'll come through it just in time to see spurs fuck something up against leicester ! i'm currently making an attempt to learn swedish using duolingo , it's interesting so far . seems like it'll be hard to pronounce though .
they would need a guidance system and a worthwhile payload which is probably a bigger challenge than the rocket , and something like falcon is the wrong design for a ballistic missile .
" man the pathing in this game sucks "
been able to simply printout my fleets and play . also saves fleets . since i started using it i don't need to pullout my cards .
taper the tails more finely , like the on the right
thanks so much for posting this ....
i feel ya bro you not the only one
yet research has shown that for wives of men with larger penises , the rate of infidelity increases proportionally to their husbands ' penis size . and the men the women cheat with have smaller penises that their husbands do . one study showed that every one inch longer in penis length increased the likelihood of a wife’s infidelity by almost one - and - half times . “ women associated large penises with pain and discomfort during sex which precludes the enjoyment and sexual satisfaction that women are supposed to feel ,” wrote the authors of this new research . their report appears in plos one . it's great that women who like and are able to accommodate large penises are now more easily able to get together with the guys who have them . but average - sized guys who are wishing they were huge need to know that a solid majority of women who have tried a porn - sized dick say " no way !"
still black folks ... but the football kind
or demonise trans people .
paradise lost , by john milton this has been sitting on my bookshelf for a long time , and i know for sure this will take me more than a week to get through . but i started reading it yesterday and surprisingly , when i've warmed up to the style and language , i found that it was more engaging than i thought .
do not try to user catch or treat it like 15 . pass the ball , choose the catch , then wait until the receiver has the ball to make any moves . i used to do everything user but now , you will drop almost every pass .
i'm pretty sure msrp is 35 a pop . and an unlimited print run will keep the price at / below msrp . the reason there were pricing issues before was tnn made one deck way more valuable than the others . shouldn't be a problem here .
i struck a nerve clearly . maybe you should try listening to dan carlin's blueprint for salt the definitive guide to dealing with saltiness .
her ( inofficial ) name is candy mane , btw . and her appearance is coincidence .
they ruin wood doors
tcot the changing of times , their 2002 release before spencer haha . still hella psyched though .
is that true , though ? i thought that upconverting would give it a little better quality , but not so much as to actually warrant a new release . right ? or is it literally the same ?
it's discouraging to hear we have a good system .
you are underselling yourself . unfortunately , you're in kind of a desperate situation , and you can't afford to waste time getting yourself psychologically prepared before you apply for jobs . it could be good for you in the long run . desperation can sometimes get things done .
it's only baiting if you know your views aren't morally justified . if bernie sanders was so sure of his views he wouldn't have had a problem answering that question .
this exactly sums up how i've felt this season . every bit of promise and hope for the future has been squandered by poor decision - making on the part of the fo and coaching staff . mediocrity is one thing but hinchey and bravo have driven our club into the ground .
official fit arena2k15 power rankings :
wasn't redrum written on the board outside stella's door in episode 1 ? they seem to like their foreshadowing
lucas duda has to be the # 1 met all time in nyc - area lookalikes . i see people that look like him walking around all the time .
the sizeof one is vicious
he played the plantation owner who originally owned django and hildy . he had the weird glasses and seemed to take a lot of pleasure in breaking up django and hildy .
nope right out of that one ! if they have to have access have them open a screen share and you can log in and see what they are doing .
why did this not happen , because araki .
i actually lost the first battle by a ton of strokes lol . i shot a damn ball up a ramp into a little house - machine - shortcut and it didn't go straight in the hole but his shot did wtf ? the minigolf course was rigged i think . i think i can win if we 1v1 at minesweeper though i'm pretty damn good at minesweeper .
does the fact that danny is killed by a black guy make neo - nazism good or correct ? i hope that that wasn't your takeaway .
well , the argos are used to it by now . they played their first five games on the road , ( and no , i don't count the " home opener " in fort macmurry as a home game ). at this point they may as well just become an all - road team .
exploitation of workers isn't just a problem caused between owners / management and labor within any single firm . firms have to compete for funding to stay in business because better funded firms develop production advantages . basically , if you run a cooperative enterprise you still have to offer your surplus value to a financier to stay in the game . the profit motive in a capitalist economy isn't there to motivate investors — it exists as a part of the feedback loop that sustains the separation of power between those who control capital and those who need access to it . until you have a system where you don't have to prove to someone that you'll increase their net worth before you're allowed to take part in productive enterprise you're not going to really fix things in a meaningful sense .
he's a bit of a shitcunt is affelay isn't he ?
i summon bill nye the doubles guy for checking prowess .
i'm not straight in any way . i am a female - assigned - at - birth individual ( a person who was labeled , erroneously , as female when i was born ,) who has undergone hormone therapy with testosterone to make my body match who i am in my head . i was never actually a girl , and so i was never actually straight . people just thought i was . i am a gay man .
really liked knights of sidonia . great dub , jyb did his thing . love melissa fahn and wendee lee . whole cast is pretty stellar . season 1 2 for me , but i'm not much of a fan of the character tsumugi . first episode of prison school was hilarious . dub is pretty good . was worried about alexis tipton , but she fits well . can't wait for more . i hate to say it but the disappearance of nagato yuki chan is not a very good show , but the dub is obviously splendid . really nice hearing the cast back together at least . of the shows you mentioned that i've watched , i found the kill la kill dub really good , but the show is pretty dull . it is a chore to watch . really like the casting on ryuuko and mako , though . ping pong was amazing , and dubbed almost perfectly . nagi no asukara was a good show with a good dub to match . assassination classroom is alright , and death parade was awesome .
yeah , the necrontyr was the original . so , it explains atleast the orks and the eldar . for why the tau and the humans evolved to the same shape 60 million years later , well fuck do we know , space magic ?
it's part human nature and part social influence . most might have a natural desire to fuck , but planning children isn't instinctive . the ' want ' to keep them when they happen and start to form is where instinct generally kicks in . it's not human nature to want 6 - 7 , that's mostly a socio - economic factor , determined by culture . humans are exceeding their instinct anyway . instinctual impulses no longer dictate our specific nature , except in fear and reproduction . generally and presumptively speaking .
there's a difference between safe sex and birth control . a woman who's on the pill is exercising effective birth control , but if she's having intercourse with strangers and not using any other protection , she certainly isn't having safe sex . personally i enjoy knowing with almost certainty , right now , that i'm never going to have children , even by accident , and am able to plan my life accordingly .
the new melodic lead literally sounds like a bad remake ... like , the new sound isn't bad , but the midi programming is less sophisticated
are these it ?
i don't know how it's possible to lose 1vs1 as storm against melee hero .
haha i do think russian novels can be extremely confusing , but i always put it down to my own problem . reading anna karenina was like " waat ? who just said that ?" but it makes me feel stupid .
i was at raw in nashville 2013 ( that stupid one where we all got suckered into watching florida georgia line ) and there was a guy passing those out . when the match finished and the lights dimmed for commercial break cesaro turned around and bowed to the crowd .
i second this comment . if you can answer most of easy and medium questions , you should be in good shape and you should be able to derive the solutions for the hard questions with the help of your interviewer .
it still bothers me how badly modelled the bucket of chicken girl is compared to the rest of the cast .
no screenshots , no pictures with added / superimposed text .
well as a heterosexual male i would not give a shit . well , as long as they passed so as to avoid confusion .
this monitor seems to be great for gpus that run in that frame rate in max settings ( 285 , 380 ). pair it with the frame rate limit in ccc and freesync and you'll get smooth as hell gameplay .
love how people keep claiming that they're gonna quit when the switch happens cuz they're gonna have 60 - 80 ping instead of 20 - 40 . welcome to what the rest of us have been lucky to play at for the past 5 years .
in effect you've made me a god lol nobody knows you , and we'll forget all about you soon . enjoy your 5 minutes in the spotlight bb .
what's your question ? it sounds like the company doesn't have enough money to pay its debts . it's likely to go bankrupt . you should definitely start looking for another job . few things to think about : 1 . there are priorities for paying claims in bankruptcies . claims for past wages come pretty far up the list -- above the claims that former customers may have . that should include claims for accrued vacation if the company would have paid that out had you been terminated . 2 . you should contact your insurance company to find out about health insurance . 3 . you can hold onto the chromebook , but it's still company property . at some point , either the company or a bankruptcy trustee will want it back .
how true is that story ? i've heard some really poorly fabricated stories about ibn hajar ra .
i wouldn't mind seeing miz win and try and insert himself somewhere near cena . i think they could do good work on the mic together .
does this not work anymore ? :/
religion is good .
you should kill yourself .
i'm sorry , but this comment is very poorly thought out . " if you don't like it , then leave ." do i have to explain why this is asinine ?
i just had to do this .
although the mother is right about the matter itself , it is not the best idea to shout it out to the world like this . imagine she is 80 years old and the daughter takes care of her and does the same thing - how would she like it ?
it is serious and self - aware , which is a pretty uniquely kojima thing to have in a game . it's not just " comic relief " moments either , it's just this pervasive sense of him taking his favorite , serious , gritty components of western culture and film ( escape from la , etc ) and giving it some kind of japan ( imation ) ese twist of " i give no fucks , here's a chick that has huge tits and can turn invisible "
somewhat recent popular anime's main character had an attack based on rock paper scissors . so basically it's his inner weaboo leaking out
i think that as he is in clinical practice dealing with the effects of smoking and the real toll its having on families he's probably not being dramatic so much as telling it as he sees it .
as the creator of superfight , i hope my opinion is worth something when i say i could not care less what rules he or anyone else uses . the point of the game is to argue over nonsense . as long as that's happening and it's funny , we all win . steve has become a friend of mine , and he could go on there and claim superfight is an eating contest where you have to eat more cards than anyone else , and i wouldn't care . this is all fun nonsense , and i love it .
i should note that the equipment of the party is deplorable , as they started this story line with nothing . they have accumulated 1 suit of leather armor ( ranger ), 1 shield ( barbarian ) 1 1 quarterstaff ( ranger ) and 1 1 short sword ( barbarian ) in addition to a couple other mundane weapons . so even though the duergar only get 4 to hit , they were hitting fairly often . the duergar , though , were wearing no armor but carrying shields , lowering their listed ac from 16 to 12 .
well you opened my eyes you have some interesting facts and toughts . also i think it comes at the end to personal preference what gun fits your play - stile
magus of the tabernacle puts your opponent on tilt . guaranteed .
in another example , the nrl is like watching porn . you slowly start jerking it to rts on friday , rub your balls to jt on saturday and work both hands to gi on sunday and before you know it , shame and disgust comes over you when you realize you're watching titans and eels on a monday .
that can't happen .
trying out all the characters and seeing what fits you best . don't let other people's opinions colour your own . for example i sucked with freya but recently started playing her again and well ... she is probably one of my favourite goddesses .
well he did play for him much longer .
thanks for that , res tagged op as " lies about dumb shit " in fuschia .
you don't seem to be providing a counter argument ... care to elaborate ? or are you , as i suspect , just blowing air out of your ass ?
yeah , by that token / r / murica is a hate sub .
i really don't care about indie dance week tbh
they're not " abandoned " they're " dropped " fawns . this is how all white tail are born .
i think that was just a concept sketch , and they scrapped the idea to give him a robot arm in the final film . not sure why you're getting downvoted though .
he wanted to know if switching would be allowed in competitive / ranked play . yes , character swapping is designed as a core mechanic in the game and that's not going to change any time soon . he also wanted to know what kind of personal progression there would be in the game . unknown i wanted to know how would the game reward me for becoming a better and overall more skillful player . hopefully a ranked ladder , but afaik nothing has been officially announced . i can't imagine them not having some form of ranked play though . are there only going to be new heroes ? are there going to be new weapons ? are there going to be alternate abilities ? the heroes themselves will remain static in their design . no new weapons or skills . there is no reason for either of those in a game where you plan on making more heroes , which they do , and it'd make the game a nightmare to properly balance .
when i fly with other rc hobbyists ( at least ones i didn't introduce to rc ), they're generally old school fixed wing guys that love the ama . this is part of the answer . there's an old school rc hobbyist who worked out all these rules and place to fly in ways that meant the public would hardly ever notice them . they're the ones who started , joined up , and largely run the ama . now there's an influx of new people who never knew these rules , and they fly in public parks and people get angry and look to shut down the whole hobby . this worries the older rc folks , and while there is merit to their position , they also tend to cite their concerns in grumpy old man language . naturally , this causes a generational divide in the hobby , and the ama is firmly on the older side .
well , you probably have social conservatives in mind . they're the ones who want to use laws to apply their own sense of morality to the citizenry . for some reason , this seems to be the gop's go - to flavor of candidate for as long as i can remember at least . it's probably to provide a stark contrast to obama , who is actually pretty moderate . anywho , these republicans have been in the spotlight for the longest time and the majority of people are getting it into their heads that all republicans are old , shriveled hardliners with religious hang - ups . republicans actually represent a broader idea of less government . fiscal conservatives ( the other type you might inadvertently hate ) believe in fewer government regulations to businesses . libertarians are interested in giving more rights back to the people . republicans can be very reasonable , but the people running the party seem to enjoy shining the spotlight on the hardliners who make republicans look like a parade of batshit crazy religious zealots . if they wanted to champion a candidate because that candidate can change america for the better , they'd probably think , " well , these democrats are also trying to change things up . we can't look like we're on the same page here . let's just find a candidate who promises to keep everything the same ."
or at least show the map time before connecting .
he's got a bloody right to say .
stannis , i'm going to make you proud , big boy . fewer , not less .
wow , reddit is really not very interesting anymore .
