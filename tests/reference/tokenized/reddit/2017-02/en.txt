imagine how utterly fucked we'd be if the current president could use the justice department to go after his congressional opponents . slow down , let's give him till march for that executive order . i wouldn't be surprised if they had at least one instance of telling him , " no , we can't by executive order have the fbi ' pick up ' everyone involved in the washington v trump lawsuit , including the judges , unless they ' play ball '."
great post that inspired me to visit troon / bft . also , those empenadas were incredible !
just because comey is an ass doesn't mean he can't be a useful ass .
you should do some research . the spokesperson for the pipeline went in a media tour before obama did a thing to say it wasn't going forward with it because it was no longer viable
fiat volume leading a rally ? this is new ...
its a great day for canada and therefore the world .
like a thousand butts .
if a blm is repeatedly ripping aggro from you then he's doing good dps i'd prefer that to scathe mages
on the contrary , gelebor expresses hope that they might someday be able to , and notes a rise in their intelligence . plus , black souls are an artificial construct , there is no actual difference between white and black souls besides possibly size . i don't know if they'll ever be able to return to their original forms , but it might be possible for them to eventually become something more than the savage race they are right now .
but the puck doesn't go in unless you shoot it , and shoot it hard . luck has a lot to say about the outcome of hockey games , but you have to put yourself in position to be lucky . take marleau's goal from the sharks game sunday night , he was amazingly lucky , but if he wasn't skating hard for the net he wouldn't have had the puck land on his stick . there's something to be said for players who are eager to put the puck on net . he's a third - liner , eh's not going to be skating in circles maintaining possession like marchand . vatrano can make things happen with his shot . didn't ignore context , just didn't want to write all of that the first time .
yeah ! that's the one ! i'll try that when i get back from lunch . thanks !
i wouldn't buy from him if his name was hiram lodge .
tempting , but that's what they're all hoping for .
that's not a flaw , that's integrity .

when they showed the graphic of boston having 36 championships and atlanta only having one .... i died

anywhere we'll be able to watch it live without regular tv stations ? edit : here it is !
the wesker using the bladed gun as the samurai edge is genius .
if they could just give us dirt 1 with the technology ( graphics physics ) of a currentyear game , i'd buy it in a heartbeat . i loved dirt 1 and think it was the best of the series . every other game tried to be prettier and focus more on fewer racing modes , but the variety and sane ui of the first games is what made dirt 1 best in the series .
would you consider make a metal version of the skyva ? :)
yes of course , because when there are multiple countries that you can go to to avoid starvation in your own hemisphere or on the same continent , you should go all the way the fuck across an ocean and to a completely different culture to do so ! i do not see a problem with this whatsoever .
it's not luck if it's a reroll on an emulator
if feminists acknowledged real victims they wouldn't be able to call themselves victims .
ohhhh , this is sooo cute !!
i wonder if yularen knew if vader was anakin
someone needs to sit him down and honestly ask him , " do you want your last days on earth to be you being the worst president in us history ?"
not this season . however , if we don't make it far in the play - off this year ( or , god forbid , we don't make the play - offs at all ), then i think bergevin should seriously consider finding a new coach . i don't think therrien is a bad coach , but coaches have a shelf life . therrien has been here 5 years now , and while we have been solid , we haven't really looked a like a threat for the cup under his leadership . it may be getting close to the time we need to consider a different voice to see if that can get us to the next level .
ok , listen up . delete her from all your social media . you don't need to tell her why ( maybe do the same to all of those toxic people ). if she goes around and defames you then that's on her , nothing you can do . ignore her and her friends and move on with your life . off topic but who the fuck laughs at someone for crying due to a relative dying ? what an absolute cunt ( maybe this is hitting way too close to home , sorry )
wow chika really was waiting to appear until the end . i hope you get to idolize her , because the idlz copy is so pretty ! i think you had pretty good scouts overall too ! also i'm glad to see another fan of chika , they're more or less hard to come by in the fandom haha ( maybe i'll see more of us this week !)
well then why are you here reading it all and commenting if you find it ridiculous ? i'm not being rude but it just seems like a waste of your time if you don't enjoy what's being discussed .
... well , you've given me a simple method for ' super - slow xp gain .'
he is not wrong . we have to be fair on him . choosing someone based on his / her religious belief is not wrong , as it is up to each person whether he wanted to put religious beliefs as a factor to choose , or not . forcing everybody to dismiss religion as a factor to choose a leader is on the same vein with forcing everybody to use religion as a factor to choose a new leader . true , ahok supporters may interpret this wrongly , but there is nothing wrong on what he has said .
i imagine one of the things they'll do before release is finish updating the premium cards so that they all look badass . there's still a few clunkers that just have the sheen to them and not anything special .
i have a better candidate : " as soon as i bared my butt , i knew he'd crack ."
pretty sure he is smiling because he found a new group . they have numbers now .
up / downvotes alone aren't sufficient . the moderation of / r / spacex has always been active , but they used to have that fine balance that was excellent without being overbearing . they've lost the balance recently .
hi kevin , do you think the rise of crypto currency ( bitcoins , etc .) will have a net positive or negative effect on society ?
ummm ... i know what you mean . so many bloody noses early on ...
try killing red units instead ? having 20 % instead of - 20 % atk is quite noteworthy even if your attack is as shitty as odins .
did it look like your season ?
good ? andrei kovalenko perhaps . the tank !
so say there's 2 " greys " on my team and one of them is other side of the map . i see something on a radar relevant to that person . how do i know which person it is to give info to if i'm not calling them by colour ?
he could laugh at nothing and make it funny
i had similar issues but i finally found a budget that works for me . it also helps that i ( finally ) am making enough to live comfortably and be able to save . sounds dumb but it's true .... starting to budget when that means cutting out everything you enjoy is tough . budgeting when you're being responsible but not giving up all luxuries is much easier . my budget is essentially two spreadsheets : 1 . set costs - everything that will have a set price and is absolutely necessary . this includes rent , annual doctor visit co - pay , car insurance etc . i also include my savings in here . 2 . daily ( variable ) costs - i track everything else i spend here . i have a set daily budget . the goal isn't to spend less than the daily amount every day but to stay under it on average . i average it out by month and since i've started . this way if my daily is 30 and i need to buy something that's 100 , i'll try to not spend any money for 4 days to " save " up for it . i have categories here just in case i want to dig more into it later and to kind of focus on where my money is going but that's not really super important beginning out . to get my daily budget i figure out my monthly fixed costs ( i pay car insurance twice a year so 1 / 6 of that is my monthly etc ). i subtract my monthly fixed from my monthly take home pay and then divide that amount by 30 to get my daily budget . ( so .... daily ([ monthly take home pay ] - [ monthly fixed costs ])/ 30 ) some things to consider - if you're starting out it's going to be tough . give yourself some props just for recording everything . that's the first step . also , try to make your daily a reasonable amount so you can meet your goals . once you're comfortable , you can always increase your savings and decrease your daily budget , but the first step is doing something . i also tend to get anxiety about my budget but it was amazing how just knowing how i was spending my money helped with that . i felt like i had more control . also , the daily is less restrictive than x amount for groceries etc etc so i feel like i have more freedom . if i really feel like i need to buy make - up then i can make that up by eating ramen or whatever for a couple days .
but they only want sponsor logos or colors . you can still create something better with that than we seen .
what ? krul is terrible against aggro shaman and aggro rogue . if you haven't died by turn nine against those decks , then you're probably sitting pretty .
yeah , it's like u / secretlyamosinnagant said - it's not unique to rape . it's not even unique to crime . if someone writes a bad theater review or a bad restaurant review - they lose business . reputations are fickle things .
what model is that ?
there is a whole spectrum of potential bad scenarios that involve very bad changes from life as we know it which would still satisfy the requirement of humanity's survival as a species . i feel like we ought to aspire to a little bit more than base survival of the species
\ march against trump . \ we allow trump supporters . logic
maybe they only had 15 terrorists and they ran out of them in 9 / 11 but i'm 100 % sure it wasn't because trump has business tira with saudi arabia , not at all .
the fucking norm at any corporate job , can't stand it .
you're implying that eth and btc are directly correlated , which they are not . eth was at 20 and btc was at 600 , and as btc moved towards 1000 , eth moved towards 7 . that's most definitely closer to an inverse correlation , and the charts prove it .
bernie didn't even support the d nominee in that governor race . fuck him !
i dunno man , he brought the conan sword to a meeting once and said he was going to use it to cut the deficit . i'd love to have him back now that jerry has done such an awesome job balancing the budget .
did you by chance shoot a jayce empowered q through it to create a 4th dimension
oh sweet jesus i miss avp2 ' s multiplayer .
it certainly seems like it bothers you .
as someone who used to play wow , for being an mmorpg , there's a reason people are still playing it . call of duty on the other hand ... let's not go down that rabbithole of 12 year olds .
my thoughts exactly ..!
i can understand the whole two - in - one , one less thing to carry in your purse kinda edgy deal about this product , but blotting and then rolling with the same one just seems too much ... like grab a fresh one
not a movie , but i cannot stand how the entire cast of the big bang theory picks at their food during scenes .
we have this chocolate brand here , tony's , and they don't have it in the uk . so i got him one with a customized wrapper with a little message on it ! he also loves nutella and they offered customized labels so i got that too , i hope it gets here on time . and i got him some valentine edition happy socks . i might add a lush bathbomb if i have time but i'll have to send it off pretty soon if i want it to get there on time . we're both pretty much broke so i'm keeping it small . not expecting anything in return because of it either . but i love putting together packages haha
anytime , always happy to help .
trust me i don't like hillary either but let's leave the politics out of gaming
uk . you the hank moody type ?
i always thought the alaska aces were a cool quirk of the echl . international sized arena . out of the way . they are a one of a kind franchise . it'd be a shame if they can't find a way to make it work .
the slab is refrigerated . it allows the ice cream to be manipulated without it melting all over and just being a huge mess .
if he has a problem with you being sexually responsible , go be sexually responsible without him with someone who's equally as responsible , and a bit more secure . kick him to the curb .
silly americans , investigations are for hillary !
you can run multiple oses off one card if it's big enough . i've had 3 os's running on one 16gb card .
that's what i meant by rare , my bad . rare as in you will only find it if you go out and forage for it . it's not rare in the slightest in that regard though . i bet most people in this thread have seen datura or walked past datura in the wild atleast a dozen times in the life , if not this week .
that's racist against white people . hypocrisy much ?
just like misfits when they beat og right ? wait ... i'm not against having the best teams in lcs but keep the circlejerks for when they actually beat those teams .
sharr . i kept rerolling until i got her . i got no other 5 * for the longest time . thankfully i got shu as the lvl 30 legendary so it put me on the way for an ardor team . now going for ardor / ww .
i can't understand how pedro's ownership is so low amongst veteran managers . sure , willian starts ahead of him every 4 or 5 games , but the guy is a points magnet and priced under 7 .
my point is that this guy really doesn't have anything on offer that even approaches a formed thought . he is just tries to get the left to over react . he has succeeded there , but he really doesn't have " ideas " to share , just hate , sleight of hand , and empty rhetoric .
i partly agree with you . also , that's why i think the jets should consider foster at 6 . a strong d - line who could use " a missile who chases the ball and blows it up " now that harris ' age has caught up to him .
i'm upset for you , damn . my parents love black mirror . stay curious , don't let your parents aversion to thought - provoking but convetionally fucked up media stop your mind from exploring . since you can't watch anything interesting on netflix , i can send you some very interesting black mirror - esque readings if you're down to read some hella interesting things . not so fucked up but interesting : the last question , by isaac asimov -- egg * by andy weir -- seeing the 100 % perfect girl one morning * by haruki murakami -- fucked up , even more interesting : i have no mouth , and i must scream by harlan ellison -- could also watch the twilight zone . it's less fucked up than black mirror but still insanely good .
op doesn't want to go out for alone time though , he wants to stay in their home alone . it's a big difference so i doubt there's any need for caution in that respect
sponge divers have far more capacity and it's not a sport either
having lived in truro , charlottetown , montreal , toronto , and vancouver ... i'd say that vancouver has the best climate of anywhere i've lived in canada
which is a problem i have had . i called trump a fascist , because his policies and action resemble fascism , and get told he is not going to gas 6 million people . well no shit . fascism isn't a bad word , it is not nazism , it's a political philosophy and way of governance . fascism doesn't even have to mean bad , it just means what it does . to some people fascism sounds great , and to others it sounds terrifying , but it is not a slander . i hate it because if we don't call a spade a spade then we are just allowing ourselves to get undertaken by the bad side of fascism ( or basically a dictatorship ).
this implies that donald trump has a plan . he doesn't . he doesn't do things that require thinking multiple steps ahead . trump was never playing chess , he's just an idiot who has idiot followers .
you said " set of electronic scales " so its a bit confusing .
holy crap , a 470 with hitman and a wireless xbox controller for 155 . that is nuts . i should stay off that sub for the good of my wallet .
yep , it's definitely easier to be an asshole when you're an introvert and don't care to interact with others .
or , because henrich focke is scrambled after the decryption , it may just be re - encrypted after the unscramble , i'll try that as well . this still fits the circular logic as the 5 objects and genesis could lead to the bible verse , which leads to leprosy , leprosy and genus can lead to daniel danielssen , him plus jan mayen can lead back to focke . this also solves the problem of not quite being able to scramble leprosy before re - encrypting it . in short , decrypt the codes , unscramble , re - encrypt . and the completely circular logic is the clue at the alteration method , just like how the rest of 48 worked . 1321 6770 3323 6222 1531
what do you mean ' nice try there dude '? i was trying to intervene in between the two of you telling each other to ' fuck off ,' essentially , to let you know he's got a point . if you stopped caring , and admit you weren't in the know , why propagate the false information ? the guy started by making a definitive statement about who shot up the mosque . in that moment , i would assume someone would go , ' shit , really ? i heard it was three dudes shouting allahu akbar , guess i should check it out .' instead , you didn't even seem to care what the true information was , you just shared the wrong information anyways . also , you're trying to counter me by saying ' i don't watch any news channels .' well , okay , that wasn't the point . my point was just ' the place where you get your news from .' you obviously heard ' three men shouting allahu akbar ' from somewhere . i meant that place .
sort of silly to reduce 20 % of your income in retirement savings to spend 10 % of your income on furnishing an apartment . you can be frugal and furnish for under 2,000 . dont by everything at once and be patient and take advantage of used shit .
he was suspended a while ago for hate speech . redditors link to the page as a joke .
well , look at the username ..
i just wanted to add another point as to why shaman is in such a stupid place balance wise . no one should be able to pick up a deck , play suboptimally , and faceroll their way to rank 5 with little to no effort .
this one always seems like the absolute worst . it was abundantly clear on replay that zero contact was made . holtby took one step after glenny passed him . then , on his next step he bit it and we scored . unlike the penalty shot example when a goal still isn't guaranteed when the call is made , in this cause , we had the puck in the net . ugh .
there are two that match that description . unfortunately one of those videos is private now . however , part of the song is featured in an mmd at about 00 : 19 is the other one :
this . this is my favorite episode
i mean , he hasn't played for half a year and did save us a couple of times this match . his second yellow was also kind of bullshit
damn dude . congrats . i'm still not sure if i want to do it lol . the dream would definitely be pogba for me .
i am in the same boat ; i feel like i really wish this subreddit would be better for supporters ; but askdonald actually feels that it has more support . simply due to the fact that here is a more serious discussion , perhaps .
/ uj i feel like im the only guy with internet access that hasn't seen this video
i told siri my name was dave for that exact raisin .
i'm so glad henson is still getting mins in this game to help our offensive comeback . his ability to catch ( the ball that is ) and create ( turnovers that is ) has been super beneficial this year
depends what you consider " major " or " alternative ", but i use passwordsafe . it's entirely local , so if you're looking for something cloud - based , it's not for you . ( i mean , you can put the database on a cloud drive or whatever , but there's no web ui .)
you had 56k ? my isp could only handle 33.6 because they hadn't implemented compression handlers into their gateway . i went directly from a 800ping 33.6 dial up to a 256k 170ping broadband connection .
better yet , if you get hit once , best to just set the controler down and let the enemy finish the combo .
undead axe midget is literally the highest upvoted thread on this subreddit . just click top and it's there .
watch this get reposted in a couple of hours . edit : we did it reddit !
this will just make the left even more violent when we eventually win . great job ...
my favorite deck is ub control and i have to play those ruinous paths but would strongly prefer them at instant speed .
true , but the last intentional walk of a leadoff batter occurred on june 11 , 2007 when the blue jays walked barry bonds . in the last 30 years ( 1987 - 2016 ), there have been only 6 intentional walks to the leadoff batter . 5 of the 6 were to barry bonds . i can't imagine that it will start to occur more frequently . at least triple plays have a chance of happening .
it's nothing more than a vestigial organ of democracy now

oh shit waddup , that buffalo wild wings hyper secret ultra quad ancient rare has like a pull rate of 1 in 500 booster cases ... gfg , op ! get that psa 10 graded , sell it and you qualify to be part of the yacht club on / r / wallstreetbets .

the doj essentially appealed the orginal stay and lost , nothing has been resolved in terms of the eo being overturned yet . the merits of the case have not been argued yet . still a bit to go . likely won't be over until the supreme court rules it constitutional / unconstitutional .
that's another way to go about it . i did an 1860 career once , it was a lot of fun but i couldn't win the bundesliga .
i'm not sure how much it has changed since then because i didn't play from the very beginning , but i'd say right now , it's a great time to be playing the game . the current banners ' format is great , giving you a big chance of getting something good , and will further improve in a few weeks . not to mention a guaranteed 5 * on 11x draws . you don't need a full team with burst weapons to complete most of the game's content . the basic strategies and abilities play a huge role on how you're gonna beat levels . if you don't already have them make sure to have protectga and shellga , they're your new best friends . make sure to work your way into making full break if you don't already have it , as well as power breakdown and magic breakdown . if you don't have those , power break and magic break will suffice until you get them . if you have any utility soul breaks that give you wall , hastega , boostga , faithga , perfect ! that just means you'll have more versatility on what roaming warrior you're gonna take to a dungeon . if not , you can always roaming warrior them . if you're running a mainly physical team , i suggest following a bunch of shout roaming warriors . if you have a solid mage team , sheepsong or ley lines are they way to go . there's also metamorphose , but that doesn't give you hastega . there are a lot of different boostga / faithga soul breaks with different secondary effects and such , so see which ones suit you best ! sentinel's grimoire and / or stoneskin ii while very helpful ( if not the most helpful ), they're mostly just safety nets . i've been clearing 99 % of the game's content without them since i started playing . lastly , i know everyone's gonna be saying this , but try to save some mythril for the upcoming anniversary . we're getting a bunch of supposedly really great banners for a chance to score a variety of relics , so that's something to look forward to ! it'll arrive around march 26 i think . hope you have a fun time coming back to the game ! c :
sure , that makes sense . no other country needs doctors .
yes ! it will be soon in release by default .
good on the muslims !
forget it . everyone typifies sports cities , and we just got typified as " assholes ". new england gets " douchebags ", seattle gets , " 13 year olds on xbox live ", d.c . gets " fair weather fans ", dallas gets " likes whoever has the most championships ", la gets " doesn't really care about the sport ", oakland gets " we stab people ", cleveland gets " hopeless man loses little bit of hope he didn't realize he still had ". the only thing that bugs me is philly fans and nyc fans can both do the same thing but new yorkers are " passionate " and philadelphians are " classless "
this show has gotten so much better in the last few episodes . it's a shame that many people here don't watch it .
so it caught on fires dozens of times before the epa . zero times after the epa . but it's just a coincidence ?
i always thought that tendies chicken strips were the adult wing of choice but this is a new chalanger . i wonder why they are called boneless wings , is it actual wing meat that's been de boned by some kind of advanced machine , or just random chicken bits ? ( edit : i saw that they're made of chicken breast )
oh geez , this would annoy me to no end ... six sides , six sides in a hexagon !

dm should absolutely block it if blizzard is going to call it a projectile . if it's not , then they should stop referring to it as one . i'd love to see it be deflected by a genji and pull the hog to genji's location .
5g standards won't even be finalized until late 2018 .
pay attention . ask questions . bring a pocket - sized notebook , a pen , a sharpie , your hat , jacket , black pants , and black non - slip shoes . and obviously , don't be late .
coulda just gone with a 4runner in that case . ( as if a well maintained xj won't run until the wheels fall off .) just amazes me that someone that likes one would like the other .

my assumption is that lovelien intervened in whatever dispute stay was having with the group from the party bus . he tried to break it up and they jumped him too . he was on the ground and they kicked / stomped him to death . that's what i think happened .

20 / 20 is great , but they were walking on eggshells the entire time . keith owned that interview , you can tell . it wasn't their finest by far .
4 goldfish in a 10 gallon tank . 4 goldfish in an uncycled 10 gallon tank . 10 gallon tank is full of fresh , untreated tapwater . water is being heated to a nice cozy 78ish degrees . it's like a hot tub for the little guys . non aquatic plants in tank , buried in glass shard substrate from michaels . gravel is lightly rinsed stuff i found in the basement from a goldfish bowl we used to have 20 years ago filter is for a 10 gallon tank which i guess i did right because the tank is 10 gallons , but it isn't enough for the 4 goldfish . bacterial colony also hasn't been established in filter media . needless to say i was an awful owner and they all died shortly thereafter . i think maybe the orange one lived long enough to get into the 55 gallon i bought afterwards , but i can't remember since i no longer have the tank set up .
the real power rangers was from 1993 - 1998 aka mighty morphin to in space . it should have ended with the death of zordon , because it already wasn't great and anything after in space was a giant shit show on wheels .
nintendo is having it rough even with a possible light at the end of the tunnel . rest in peace , alan stone ...
it would just give a c - lister some attention . he obviously doesn't have much work right now , since he's sending out tweets every 5 minutes . better move would be to ignore him and let him slide back into obscurity .

every planet we reach is dead is my favorite , so probably that one . however , clint eastwood is timeless and i never get sick of it so it's a tough question

this is weird as fuck wtf
this is a common misconception . the media coverage around hobby lobby was imprecise . not that most lay people would care to understand the distinction anyway .
hrm , but an actual thermal sticker sounds like it could be a good idea . less messy and you could keep them in band - aid like packs .
great poise to sink it anyway .
i don't know if i'd request less money just to try and get into a shelter ... that money will be useful if she can just find a way too get a roof over her head . op , i'm sorry you're going through this . best wishes
honestly , i just made it up , but i guarantee it's in at least 20 shitty ghost movies . wicked are you from new england ? my folks are from those parts , and everytime i visit the extended family i hear almost everyone say that .

the cinematography at the michelin track was awesome
i get to be like mr . / u / phessler today and go to a conference yey
that's definitely why i said it had potential , i liked the part where the bird got shot and kovic freaked out . i think it's because we're so used to the humor of their other shows being either almost shocking or surprising to this which is actually scripted
i thought he was absolutely hilarious on news radio , right up until the last phil hartman episode
30 year olds today watch gumball and brag about how they were too busy being unique growing up to see adult entertainment .
one thing that needs to be pointed out though , is kindred should be struggling in a meta dominated by high damage , high mobility snowball jgs that crush her like lee sin and kha'zix and hecarim , along with lethality builds out the ass . once we wind up in a more tank heavy meta with lower damage , kindred will be stronger tbh . edit : i just hate the idea of needing marks even more than i do already , when it's so easy to get stuck at 3 - 4 marks once mid game swings around . how the fuck do you steal enemy wolves post lane phase unless you've already won the game ?
ok , here we go . how product development works is - you develop something very complex . but the first time you mess it up . you had no idea what goes into it , what issues should be planned beforehand , what kind of infrastructure you need . for bigger more complex projects , you need a supply chain and a team of vendors which is non - existent the first time . then you iterate again and refine . then you refine . after some iterations , you get a decent product . now you try a newer , more complex version of the product from scratch . this time , it's a lot easier - you know the processes , you know the vendors and their capabilities . you know a lot of the issues you may run into . the basic infrastructure ( prototyping , manufacturing , testing ) is there . the end product is great . isro is a small organization with one goal - rocketry . for a long time , they've done nothing else . build a rocket , iterate , iterate , iterate , until you get a stable product . please note that i'm not trying to belittle their achievements or the work that went into it - all this takes passionate people , intelligence and hard work . but logistically , once they built the pslv - they had a decent platform they continued making minor changes to . then they tried a bigger , heavier rocket - the gslv . they imported the cryogenic stages from russia in the beginning , tried to figure everything else . it had many failures . then because of something to do with mtcr , they couldn't get cryogenic engine tot . they spent some time indigenously developing that tech , meanwhile some launches failed . they tried , failed , tried again , until they succeeded . now there haven't been a lot of gslv launches but i'd be willing to bet that they've ironed up most of the issues and it's going to be a much more reliable platform from now on . compare that to what the drdo does . it is not one lab , it is a huge lab of some 30 - 40 subsidiaries . everything , from rifles to gear to tanks to artillery to sams to aircraft avionics gets thrown at them . and a lot of the things they are doing for the first time . same with hal ( jets , combat helicopters , utility helicopters , trainer aircraft and the whole shebang ). each such project is a huge project and these organizations are juggling 10s of them at a time . it is hard to have efficient government agencies . the incentives are just not right . it is a 100 times harder to have hugely complex and innovative government agencies . isro gets the benefit of a single focused mandate . drdo / hal do not have that luxury . gtre was given the task of developing a jet engine for tejas . they've never developed a jet engine before . there is zero infrastructure for jet engine testing in india , and they had to ship the prototype all the way to russia to use their test facilities to find and iron out the bugs . they spent a total of 400m which is measly for a jet engine . that's not to say that our government agencies are impeccably governed . of course there are issues - red tapism , corruption , higher officials preferring foreign equipment due to kickbacks . but to say that drdo / hal are incompetent while isro is the model child is vulgar oversimplification . the comparison is just not fair . remember bofors ? this is the artillery gun we bought from the sweden that was wrapped in scandal for so long . today the indian army is spoilt for choice when it comes to buying indigenous artillery guns , from developers who'll tailor it according to requirements they receive from the indian army . huge orders have been placed for these , and lack of artillery major problem that will not exist in the foreseeable future . the solution ? privatization . what the agencies have started doing recently is literally give their technology to private companies and hand - holding them until they get the hang of things . i'm just coming from aero india and found it noteworthy that a lot of indian companies have started building the smaller parts - the metal frames , cable assemblies and so on . even in complex products like avionics , uavs etc we have domestic manufacturers . i believe these will rapidly climb up the value chain , developing and assembling increasingly complex components , and maybe one day we'll see our indian lockheed martins and dassaults designing and developing entire jets . of course , there are a lot of things that could go wrong , but as they say in the share market , the fundamentals are sound . :)

to be fair , every elected official has a coi due to modern financial instruments ( mutual funds ). i'd be ok with his conflicts , but only if they are known . pretty shameful that he won't release his records . we need a constitutional amendment cracking down on all elected officials to require this release .

hypothetical don lemon interview on climate change . don : thanks for being on the show nye : thanks don don : so climate change , its really a racial issue right ? nye : what ? don : climate change at it's core is about racism in the us nye : i don't see how - don : white people are racist , america is racist . climate change effects only black people and was created by white people to oppress minorities . nye : uhhh climate change effects everyone , not just one particular race . we are all the same species and whether you're white or black you're going to feel the effects of it . don : but would you say white privilege comes into play in being better adapted for increasing heat ? nye : no don : okay but white people are racist you have to remember that . nye : and what does that have to do with climate change ? don : i'm sorry we're all out of time , thanks for being on the show bill .

do you remember when russia said the greatest threat to us was russia , and it was a huge joke ? glenn greenwald did a great segment on this when he was on tucker carlson recently . he was pointing out the hypocrisy in 2012 when mitt romney was ridiculed during a debate against obama when he kept telling people that russia was a major and serious threat to the usa . really don't appreciate how the democrats define their enemies based on what interests it serves them . it's remarkable how romney was considered a fool then but now every democrat seems to think we should struggle to sleep at night worrying about russia . or how about when bernie sanders was attacked as having a conflict of interest due to being an american / israeli dual citizen ? bernie was attacked for being an israeli dual citizen , but the truth is the only citizenship he has held is american . " senator , you have dual citizenship with israel ," rehm began , before sanders interrupted . " well , no i do not have dual citizenship with israel . i'm an american . i don't know where that question came from . i am an american citizen , and i have visited israel on a couple of occasions . no , i'm an american citizen , period ," sanders said .

her district , 10 , is trending democratic and has a cook pvi of even . should be a top priority for us in 2018 .
my point exactly , draft is not pay to win . constructed is not either , there are many top tier decks that are cheap , and the game is generous . people just need to stop saying pay to win
clapped and laughed while tommy cooper was dying on stage . he was a physical comedian , so they just thought it was part of the act .
yeah , but i've never seen a patch take more than a month at certification . if sony or ms take that long to verify a patch then it's harder to post a patch than it is to release a game there ( life of black tiger , i'm looking at ya ).

residents usually move in during the fall and stay in the same room until the end of spring semester assuming there are no issues . there are two girls per room and a shared bathroom between two rooms . before spring semester started , two girls moved out and two transfers moved in . here's when the fun starts . 1 . they moved everything out of the shared bathroom that didn't belong to them . proceeded to trash the bathroom with their idea of " decoration ". 2 . they kept the door open between their room and the bathroom and constantly made noise / drank during quiet hours . one noteworthy conversation i heard was one girl complaining that she got drunk off of one mike's hard lemonade and sucked a guy's dick for an hour . good times . 3 . had a shower speaker to play music . constantly had " dark horse " ( loudly ) on repeat while singing along in the shower . did not have great voices . 4 . general shitheads towards everyone in the hall , but usually hid when people came out to scream at them . one fateful morning , wake up at 5 am to use the bathroom . floor mat in front of toilet is wet ( stepped in it while sitting down to pee ). realized it . was . vomit . almost vomited myself . cried myself back to sleep just because the situation was bullshit and i'm extremely squeamish . turns out the two girls only " lived " on campus due to requirements but actually stayed with their family / boyfriends and rented their dorm out to a small group of their friends . this checked out because all of the descriptions of the girls changed when complaints were formed , causing lots of confusion . girls were promptly punished but still did not stay in the room . it stayed empty the rest of the semester .
music was perfect ( dj from de la soul ), small more intimate atmosphere , chappelle and everyone seemed really chill . it was fun !

for the most part it's the environmentally friendly resin that helps a lot . the material is quite dense , reduces the smell and is not toxic when ingested , produces nearly no bubbles , and warps much less than conventional resin ( on smaller kits it tends to not warp at all most of the time ). another factor is how the models are removed from their moulds ( when they're still hot or at least warm ) and forceful movement may warp them during this process and when they harden they will be out of shape . we've had a few casts that got warped a bit this way during the production rush before chinese new year , but it should be fine now .

if there were not cars around and you got caught for speeding would you be making the same complaint ? as someone who has almost been hit by cars who roll through stop signs , it's dangerous you could kill someone . what if you hit a kid ? a senior ? you might think it's no big deal to roll through a stop sign , until doing so hurts someone . it's a privilege to drive , not a right , there are enough bad drivers out there already for the love of god at least follow the rules .

there's no way that wouldn't lead to riots and violent protests from trumps core supporters . they'd claim it was a giant conspiracy to put liberals into power and go nuts .
the 12 gb plan has been around for 6 months and was clearly labeled as " limited time ". which means one shouldn't wait . also by waiting you lost out at getting 2 gb bonus per line by switching plans . so you could have simply switched to the 8 gb plan and got at least 8 gb bonus ( not sure if they gave it for more than 4 lines ). now if you switch to the 8 gb plan you get no bonus . got to take advantage of deals when they're there . so yes if you call in you can get the 16 gb plan . it's 90 , 5 lines would be 100 a month ( assuming all out of contract ). the 90 would drop if you got any work discounts . so you can get 16 gb for 190 or unlimited for 200 ( autopay ) or 210 ( no auto pay ). i'd pay the 10 extra for unlimited .
they're going to charge some fairly significant penalties . if you renew in 5 years it could easily be like 1k by that point .

they don't need to repeat songs , they have 13 albums , lots of non - album songs , and tons of covers . i wouldn't be surprised if they did some extended jammed out 4 song sets , and introduced new material / covers etc . possibly some free form jamming like they've done at festivals .
i didn't want to be the guy to hold the auction up so i ended mine earlier but looks like it didn't help out after all . atleast we have a huge lineup waiting . when i put the mamba in their wasn't nothing behind me so i figured i'd have a decent chance but ended up having the all star team show up hah .

hi , i guess someone was angry here , but the person deleted the comment lol answering your question , here in brazil the regulation regarding the height of the flight is equal to the faa far section 119 : except when necessary for takeoff or landing , no person may operate an aircraft below the following altitudes : ( a ) anywhere . an altitude allowing , if a power unit fails , an emergency landing without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface . ( b ) over congested areas . over any congested area of a city , town , or settlement , or over any open air assembly of persons , an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft . ( c ) over other than congested areas . an altitude of 500 feet above the surface , except over open water or sparsely populated areas . in those cases , the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person , vessel , vehicle , or structure . edit : so , he should be at least at 1000ft , that dumb motherfucker .

is it seen as a cruel conqueror ? a slaver ? is it considered part of your culture or just a footnote in history ? i don't think the roman empire is perceived here in the us as necessarily being either good or bad in the sense of the questions i quoted above . the answer to your overall question is actually pretty simple : just look at how ancient rome is portrayed in the media . think of movies like gladiator or the eagle ( both feature badass heroes who are roman citizens on a journey within the empire and / or its periphery , who interact with both bad and good roman officials and other citizens ). the general vibe in these movies is that rome is a massive superpower with a large government bureaucracy and sophisticated infrastructure ( the coliseum , legit roads , etc ). my feeling is that americans at least subconsciously identify with this , and when romans fight tribal barbarians in these movies it instills an " us vs them " mindset in which the romans are " us ." i would imagine this is the same for many europeans ? another important point is that americans ( though we might not even realize it or think of it in these terms ) absolutely see ourselves as part of the western world . i am going to use recent terrorist attacks in europe as an example . the paris and brussels attacks were on the news constantly after they happened . everybody heard about it . there was even a billboard on the interstate near where i live that said "# prayforbrussels ." when the paris attacks happened i had friends texting me " holy shit check the news " and stuff like that . now look at syria and iraq , where attacks like that happen every week . they rarely ever get attention unless there are huge casualties , in which case it might get a brief mention on cnn . this is because those attacks didn't happen " at home " in the west . getting back to rome : the point i am shittily attempting to make is that many americans have european roots and whether subliminally or actively , see the us as part of the european / western cultural world . most americans have at least a cursory knowledge of ancient rome ( it is part of the public school curriculum in probably every state ) and are thus at least vaguely aware of its influence in building said european / western world . so we do identify with it . just like with the " us vs them " mentality during those action movies . in a vague kind of way , i think we might see it as an ancient version of our own country . it can make mistakes , do awful , terrible things , but it is still " us ." like the us is the " world police " of the present world , the roman empire was kind of the " world police " of the classical world . imo , we view the british empire the same way . these definitely aren't things people think about much , but these are the feelings that are activated when these subjects come up , like in movies and tv shows . even stereotypical " ignorant fat americans " would have some feeling of this . sorry for the rambling , kinda off topic answer ; i thought this was actually a really thought provoking question since it made me think about how your average joe off the street sees american culture in the context of broader western civilization ( though we might not think about in those terms ). also i'm drinking right now ;) edit : formatting
i actually don't know if this is a joke or not .

so do you relive every time you've almost fallen back when your life flashes before your eyes ?
yeah , i agree . this feels like a buff where blizzard is like , " hey .. winston is in a pretty good spot we feel , but he's not really being played . this buff will get him in the public eye , again ." i personally think it would be better to tweak his interactions if possible . if you winston ult and spam click a bunch of enemies in a zarya ult , they all get knocked out and thrown around ( i'm pretty sure at least , this has happened to me at least once .) winston himself also can't leap out of zarya ult . i do think his head hitbox was sort of ridiculous ... when playing mccree it feels like hitting headshots on the bots in the practice range .. it's impossible to miss . i always thought having winston bubble trap enemies inside might be an interesting interaction .. so winston ults , traps them in a bubble and thrashes them against the bubble wall repeatedly . i don't necessarily think he needs changed all that much . he deals with certain heroes pretty well . but he's not the sort of " hard engage and dive enemy team by yourself " sort of hero .
lots of compiling and data analysis , but i'll play games on it . people talk about single - threaded performance , but a sandy bridge i5 still does fine in 2017 with a powerful gpu . unless you're in esports or absolutely demand that literally every setting is maxed all the time , the delta between an 1800x and a 7700k is not worth getting the 7700k to me . my gaming experience will be great , and i'll save tons of time in repetitive multithreaded tasks .
in my neighborhood , as soon as it snows , all these burly guys show up out of nowhere with shovels . i'm happy to pay them . however , during the last blizzard , to my surprise , i heard the familiar knock on the door , opened it , and there was a 10 year old girl . she did a great job , too .
yeah but i thought that was an accident , not by design ? like they got separated and crashed and so they had to clone eachother . and the drunk irishmen ... i kinda forget their thing .
i really underestimated the weight to value ratio cigarettes had in fallout .
get a vape pen with the disposable cartridges . go into the bathroom stall , get you a quick rip in and it will be your little secret .
no , i think it's because the competition is much steeper and an a ( in my experience ) requires excellence . in community college i would regularly get perfect scores on exams and only a few times below 90 %. many profs would give extra credit and i frequently earned that . i got a 109.5 % final grade in my stats course . the 3 points make no difference to me , it's all relative grading now . sometimes , a 45 % is twice the average !
i think there's a point to be made for separating the music and the artist . i don't think there's anything wrong with you personally boycotting an artist because of their views , but i don't think you should stop other people from listening to them . as long as the music isn't promoting these views , i'm pretty good with separating the two . like i'm not gonna stop ( or tell someone to stop ) listening to dmx or a tribe called quest because they've made homophobic songs or to dr dre and chris brown because of their woman - beating ( even though that is morally reprehensible ). i also would completely understand someone personally boycotting them . like would you be angry at someone for watching mel gibson or sean penn films ?
what narcissist would complain that their narcissism causes them to suffer ? like , acknowledging your narcissistic behavior and admitting it's a problem kind of makes you perhaps not a narcissist , no ?
the problem is that every little thing is reported as a big deal . he's the president of the united states . everything he does is a big deal . the media has no choice but to report on the things he does . it's not their fault that the things he chooses to say and do are almost exclusively absurd and ridiculous .
so my appearance means i need help ? ok honestly i hope one day you look back and realize being so negative and down isn't hurting anyone but yourself . if my face affects how you're living your life , i highly suggest you go outside for a bit and look at reality .

i say let her go with garcinia cambogia , if you read how it's advertized you realize the big font says lose weight fast but the little writing explaining it on the back describes itself as an appetite suppressant ( which it is , my dad and i used it for a while and it did help on that front ). at least it isn't quite as deceptive as those pills that " speed up your metabolism ".

do practice falls like in the video used to do judo and it helps a lot . every class we spent 5 minutes to do rolls and falls . after a few months it becomes your second nature and you don't think when you fall , your body just does the right thing . so spend some time doing side and back falls in the beginning or end of your training and see if it works for you after few weeks

to add some balance to this presumed complaint about the ' spoiler ' game result being in the post title , i don't mind this and in fact prefer it to vague titles with spoiler fluff i need to unhide . i don't like spoilers for fictional stories like movies / tv / books , but this dislike of informative news items about the real world seems odd to me : if you don't like to know what's happening in the go world don't read go news websites . so thanks for the report op !

i started playing this game when i started marathon training , and at first it was a must to have the app open so that i'd log the miles . it definitely helped me be motivated and get out to run when i didn't want to - especially on those days when i had plenty of eggs to hatch . now , even though i'm still getting in 20 - 40 miles a week , i don't ever open it . getting 1 / 4 or less of that i used to just isn't appealing and i've had eggs sitting in incubators for months . getting the speed increased would get me playing more , as the game would be a workout augment again . and what would be even better is if there was some integration with nike nrc or another workout app . giving people exp or achievements for completing workouts and meeting their goals would tie in so much better to niantic's fitness goals than what it is now - " go walk , but not too fast ."
yes : then they went back , and found thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a pipe . he was blowing the most enormous smoke - rings , and wherever he told one to go , it went - up the chimney , or behind the clock on the man - telpiece , or under the table , or round and round the ceiling ; but wherever it went it was not quick enough to escape gandalf .
i don't agree with pence , and he is a total ass to people like myself , but he's actually somewhat reasonable and not batshit insane . he's also 100x better then trump and bannon

yes it is .
i bought one for my teenage daughter and not thinking anything of it , told some mom - friends when they mentioned their kids were late to classes because of period related stuff , and i was all , " it's the best ! let me explain ." i uh ... found out a lot about how they think that day . i didn't like how they thought . ( take nothing but diva cups , leave nothing but buried period stuff .)
honeysuckle toys are available at many pet stores .. possibly online too but i hate online shopping myself ! ask at pet stores for them . its a real wood but often made into a toy . you can " refresh " the oils by freezing it or spraying it with water .
yah this nerf is a late contender for most unnecessary console nerf of all time . they need to start balancing this game seperate for consoles / pc ...... theres just no way for console players to put up the same kind of hit % as pc players ( and therefore our damage throughput suffers )
god - that's awful !
bameth doesn't really cast dd instantly . you can go away from corpses if you see beyond mobs spawning . you just have to be aware of the possibility . don't get me wrong , it's not trivial to play around everything , especially if you're going for 10k map tiers and are many hours into current run . i died many times to much easier to avoid things - like my eyes refusing to read all the mods on a map and realizing there's reflect after i did . that said , i did avoid dd many times when i was paying attention .
