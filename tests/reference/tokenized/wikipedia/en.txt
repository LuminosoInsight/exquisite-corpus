anarchism
anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self - governed societies based on voluntary , cooperative institutions and the rejection of hierarchies those societies view as unjust . these institutions are often described as stateless societies , although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non - hierarchical or free associations . anarchism holds capitalism , the state , and representative democracy to be undesirable , unnecessary , and harmful .
while opposition to the state is central , many forms of anarchism specifically entail opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations . anarchism is often considered a far - left ideology , and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti - authoritarian interpretations of communism , collectivism , syndicalism , mutualism , or participatory economics .
anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view , instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy . many types and traditions of anarchism exist , not all of which are mutually exclusive . anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally , supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism . strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications .

etymology and terminology

the word " anarchism " is composed from the word " anarchy " and the suffix - ism , themselves derived respectively from the greek , i.e . anarchy ( from , anarchos , meaning " one without rulers "; from the privative prefix ἀν - ( an -, i.e . " without ") and , archos , i.e . " leader ", " ruler "; ( cf . archon or , arkhē , i.e . " authority ", " sovereignty ", " realm ", " magistracy ")) and the suffix or (- ismos , - isma , from the verbal infinitive suffix , - izein ). the first known use of this word was in 1539 . various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists ( as maximilien robespierre did the hébertists ) although few shared many views of later anarchists . there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation , such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling , but they did not use the word " anarchist " or " anarchism " in describing themselves or their beliefs .
the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre - joseph proudhon , marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid - nineteenth century . since the 1890s and beginning in france , the term " libertarianism " has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states . on the other hand , some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only , referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism .

history


origins

the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century bc among the works of taoist philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan . zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist . zhuangzi wrote : " a petty thief is put in jail . a great brigand becomes a ruler of a nation ". diogenes of sinope and the cynics as well as their contemporary zeno of citium , the founder of stoicism , also introduced similar topics . jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition . georges lechartier wrote : " the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and [...] the first anarchist society was that of the apostles ". in early islamic history , some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate , where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the islamic society .
the french renaissance political philosopher étienne de la boétie wrote in his most famous work the discourse on voluntary servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent . the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in england . the term " anarchist " first entered the english language in 1642 during the english civil war as a term of abuse , used by royalists against their roundhead opponents . by the time of the french revolution , some such as the enraged ones began to use the term positively in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power , seeing " revolutionary government " as oxymoronic . by the turn of the 19th century , the english word " anarchism " had lost its initial negative connotation .
modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment , particularly jean - jacques rousseau's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom .
as part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the french revolution , william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought . according to peter kropotkin , godwin was " the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism , even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work " while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke .
godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism . he argued in political justice ( 1793 ) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance . he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force . although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy , he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power . rather , he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution .
his aversion to the imposition of a rules - based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people's " mental enslavement " the foundations of law , property rights and even the institution of marriage . he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation . in each case , government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement .
the french pierre - joseph proudhon is regarded as the first self - proclaimed anarchist , a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work what is property ?, published in 1840 . it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory . he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society , where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests . his famous quote on the matter is " liberty is the mother , not the daughter , of order ". in what is property ?, proudhon answers with the famous accusation " property is theft ". in this work , he opposed the institution of decreed " property " ( propriété ), where owners have complete rights to " use and abuse " their property as they wish . he contrasted this with what he called " possession ", or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use . however , proudhon later added that " property is liberty " and argued that it was a bulwark against state power . his opposition to the state , organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time .
the anarcho - communist joseph déjacque was the first person to describe himself as " libertarian ". unlike proudhon , he argued that " it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to , but to the satisfaction of his or her needs , whatever may be their nature ". in 1844 , the post - hegelian philosopher max stirner published in germany the book , the ego and its own , which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism . french anarchists active in the 1848 revolution included anselme bellegarrigue , ernest coeurderoy , joseph déjacque and proudhon himself .

first international and the paris commune

in europe , harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848 , during which ten countries had experienced brief or long - term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings . after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure , conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists , liberals and nationalists along with anarchists to prevent further revolt . in spain , ramón de la sagra established the anarchist journal el porvenir in la coruña in 1845 which was inspired by proudhon's ideas . the catalan politician francesc pi i margall became the principal translator of proudhon's works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in 1873 while being the leader of the federal democratic republican party . according to george woodcock : " these translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after 1870 , but before that time proudhonian ideas , as interpreted by pi , already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860s ". according to the encyclopædia britannica : " during the spanish revolution of 1873 , pi y margall attempted to establish a decentralised , or " cantonalist ," political system on proudhonian lines ".
in 1864 , the international workingmen's association ( sometimes called the first international ) united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon , blanquists , philadelphes , english trade unionists , socialists and social democrats . due to its links to active workers ' movements , the international became a significant organisation . karl marx became a leading figure in the international and a member of its general council . proudhon's followers , the mutualists , opposed marx's state socialism , advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings . woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william batchelder greene had been members of the first international . in 1868 , following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom ( lpf ) russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international , which had decided not to get involved with the lpf . they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international , who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property . at first , the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary socialist direction . subsequently , the international became polarised into two camps , with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads . bakunin characterised marx's ideas as centralist and predicted that if a marxist party came to power , its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against .
anarchist historian george woodcock reports : " the annual congress of the international had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the paris commune , and in 1871 the general council called only a special conference in london . one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy , while a technical excuse — that they had split away from the fédération romande — was used to avoid inviting bakunin's swiss supporters . thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present , and the general council's resolutions passed almost unanimously . most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers ". in 1872 , the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress , where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york . in response , the federalist sections formed their own international at the st . imier congress , adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme .
the paris commune was a government that briefly ruled paris from 18 march ( more formally , from 28 march ) to 28 may 1871 . the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco - prussian war . anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune . they included louise michel , the reclus brothers ( élie reclus and élisée reclus ) and eugene varlin ( the latter murdered in the repression afterwards ). as for the reforms initiated by the commune , such as the re - opening of workplaces as co - operatives , anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised . moreover , the commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of proudhon on french radical ideas . the commune's vision of a communal france based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes bakunin's and proudhon's ideas ( proudhon , like bakunin , had argued in favour of the " implementation of the binding mandate " in 1848 and for federation of communes ), thus both economically and politically the paris commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas . george woodcock states that " a notable contribution to the activities of the commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions , including the mutualists courbet , longuet , and vermorel , the libertarian collectivists varlin , malon , and lefrangais , and the bakuninists elie and elisée reclus and louise michel ".

organised labour

the anti - authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho - syndicalists , seeking to " replace the privilege and authority of the state " with the " free and spontaneous organization of labour ". in 1886 , the federation of organized trades and labor unions of the united states and canada unanimously set 1 may 1886 as the date by which the eight - hour work day would become standard .
in response , unions across the united states prepared a general strike in support of the event . on 3 may , a fight broke out in chicago when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd . the next day on 4 may , anarchists staged a rally at chicago's haymarket square . a bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally , killing an officer . in the ensuing panic , police opened fire on the crowd and each other . seven police officers and at least four workers were killed . eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer . the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement . four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution . the incident became known as the haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight - hour day . in 1890 , a second attempt — this time international in scope — to organise for the eight - hour day was made . the event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the haymarket affair . although it had initially been conceived as a once - off event , by the following year the celebration of international workers ' day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday .
in 1907 , the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries , among which were important figures of the anarchist movement , including errico malatesta , pierre monatte , luigi fabbri , benoît broutchoux , emma goldman , rudolf rocker and christiaan cornelissen . various themes were treated during the congress , in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement , popular education issues , the general strike or antimilitarism . a central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism ( or trade unionism ). malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient . he thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative , citing as essentially bourgeois and anti - worker the phenomenon of professional union officials . malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself , whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it .
in 1881 , the spanish workers federation was the first major anarcho - syndicalist movement — anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain . the most successful was the confederación nacional del trabajo ( national confederation of labour , cnt ), founded in 1910 . before the 1940s , the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics , attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the spanish civil war . the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association , a federation of anarcho - syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922 , with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in europe and latin america . in latin america in particular , "[ t ] he anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america , and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in mexico , brazil , peru , chile , and argentina were anarcho - syndicalist in general outlook ; the prestige of the spanish c.n.t . as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation . the largest and most militant of these organisations was the federación obrera regional argentina [...] it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million , which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions ".

propaganda of the deed and illegalism

some anarchists , such as johann most , advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter - revolutionaries because " we preach not only action in and for itself , but also action as propaganda ". scholars such as beverly gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder , but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population , such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed . however , most himself once boasted that " the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents . therefore , massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion ". most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885 , the science of revolutionary warfare , a how - to manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in new jersey .
by the 1880s , people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan , " propaganda of the deed " to refer to individual bombings , regicides and tyrannicides . from 1905 onwards , the russian counterparts of these anti - syndicalist anarchist - communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal " expropriations ". illegalism as a practice emerged and within it "[ t ] he acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (" propaganda by the deed ") and the anarchist burglars (" individual reappropriation ") expressed their desperation and their personal , violent rejection of an intolerable society . moreover , they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt ". france's bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism .
however , important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts as soon as 1887 . peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in le révolté that " a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite ". a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action , for example through the trade union movement . the anarcho - syndicalist fernand pelloutier argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without " the individual dynamiter ".
state repression ( including the infamous 1894 french lois scélérates ) of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed in the first place to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics , although reciprocally state repression may have played a role in these isolated acts . the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and — following the suppression of the 1871 — paris commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts .
numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement , including tsar alexander ii of russia , president sadi carnot of france , prime minister antonio cánovas del castillo of spain , empress elisabeth of austria , king umberto i of italy , president william mckinley of the united states , king carlos i of portugal and king george i of greece . mckinley's assassin leon czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist emma goldman .

russian revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s

anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution . however , following a political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left - wing opposition the conflict culminated in the 1921 kronstadt rebellion , which the new government repressed . anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned , driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks ; the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine . in the free territory , they fought in the civil war against the whites ( a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution ) and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno , who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months .
expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were among those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising , before they left russia . both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia , criticising the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised . for them , bakunin's predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new " socialist " marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true .
the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally . many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example and communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements . in france and the united states , for example , members of the major syndicalist movements of the general confederation of labour and industrial workers of the world ( iww ) left the organisations and joined the communist international .
the revolutionary wave of 1917 – 1923 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism . in the german uprising known as the german revolution of 1918 – 19 which established the bavarian soviet republic , the anarchists gustav landauer , silvio gesell and erich mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures . in the italian events known as the biennio rosso , the anarcho - syndicalist trade union unione sindacale italiana " grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the italian anarchist union ( 20,000 members plus umanita nova , its daily paper ) grew accordingly [...] anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces ." in the mexican revolution , the mexican liberal party was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in baja california with the leadership of anarcho - communist ricardo flores magón .
in paris , the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles , which included nestor makhno , concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism . their 1926 manifesto , called the organisational platform of the general union of anarchists ( draft ), was supported . platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america . synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives . in the 1920s , this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien faure . it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations .

conflicts with european fascist regimes

in the 1920s and 1930s , the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state . italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and benito mussolini's fascists . italian anarchists played a key role in the anti - fascist organisation arditi del popolo , which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism , such as repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august 1922 . the veteran italian anarchist luigi fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism , describing it as " the preventive counter - revolution ". in france , where the far - right leagues came close to insurrection in the february 1934 riots , anarchists divided over a united front policy .
anarchists in france and italy were active in the resistance during world war ii . in germany , the anarchist erich mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 february 1933 , within a few hours after the reichstag fire in berlin . joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister , labelled him as one of " those jewish subversives ". over the next seventeen months , he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at sonnenburg , brandenburg and finally , oranienburg . on 2 february 1934 , mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 july 1934 , mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards , his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning .

spanish revolution

in spain , the national anarcho - syndicalist trade union cnt initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right - wing election victory . in 1936 , the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power . months later , conservative members of the military , with the support of minority extreme - right parties , responded with an attempted coup , causing the spanish civil war ( 1936 – 1939 ). in response to the army rebellion , an anarchist - inspired movement of peasants and workers , supported by armed militias , took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land . however , the anarchists were losing ground even before the fascist victory in 1939 in a bitter struggle with the stalinists , who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the republicans cause from the soviet union . according to noam chomsky , " the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the spanish anarchists . not just in catalonia — the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere . the communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists , partially because stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with western countries against adolf hitler . that failed and stalin withdrew the support to the republic . they even withdrew the spanish gold reserves ". the events known as the spanish revolution was a workers ' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years , primarily catalonia , aragon , andalusia and parts of levante . much of spain's economy was put under worker control and in anarchist strongholds like catalonia the figure was as high as 75 %, but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence as the soviet - allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivisation enactment . factories were run through worker committees , agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes . anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution , which he claimed " came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history ". spanish communist party - led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists . the prominent italian anarchist camillo berneri , who volunteered to fight against francisco franco was killed instead in spain by gunmen associated with the spanish communist party . the city of madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last non - francoist mayor of the city , the anarchist melchor rodríguez garcía .

post - war years

anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of italy and france . the mexican anarchist federation was established in 1945 after the anarchist federation of the centre united with the anarchist federation of the federal district . in the early 1940s , the antifascist international solidarity and the federation of anarchist groups of cuba merged into the large national organisation asociación libertaria de cuba ( cuban libertarian association ). from 1944 to 1947 , the bulgarian anarchist communist federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement , but was repressed by the new communist regime . in 1945 in france the fédération anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist federazione anarchica italiana was founded in italy . korean anarchists formed the league of free social constructors in september 1945 and in 1946 the japanese anarchist federation was founded . an international anarchist congress with delegates from across europe was held in paris in may 1948 . after world war ii , an appeal in the fraye arbeter shtime detailing the plight of german anarchists and called for americans to support them . by february 1946 , the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in germany was a large - scale operation . the federation of libertarian socialists was founded in germany in 1947 and rudolf rocker wrote for its organ , die freie gesellschaft , which survived until 1953 . in 1956 , the uruguayan anarchist federation was founded . in 1955 , the anarcho - communist federation of argentina renamed itself as the argentine libertarian federation . the syndicalist workers ' federation ( swf ) was a syndicalist group in active in post - war britain , and one of solidarity federation's earliest predecessors . it was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved anarchist federation of britain ( afb ). unlike the afb , which was influenced by anarcho - syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself , the swf decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist , worker - centred strategy from the outset .
anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time , such as albert camus , herbert read , paul goodman , dwight macdonald , allen ginsberg , george woodcock , leopold kohr , julian beck , john cage and the french surrealist group led by andré breton , which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the fédération anarchiste .
anarcho - pacifism became influential in the anti - nuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the english anarchist member of campaign for nuclear disarmament alex comfort or the similar activism of the american catholic anarcho - pacifists ammon hennacy and dorothy day . anarcho - pacifism became a " basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the cold war ". the resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in robert graham's a documentary history of libertarian ideas , volume two : the emergence of the new anarchism ( 1939 – 1977 ).

contemporary anarchism

a surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s . anarchism was influential in the counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts . in 1968 , in carrara , italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing european federations of france ( the fédération anarchiste ), the federazione anarchica italiana of italy and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgarian federation in french exile .
in the united kingdom in the 1970s , this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols . the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of barcelona , spain . in denmark , squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the freetown christiania , an autonomous haven in central copenhagen . since the revival of anarchism in the mid - 20th century , a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged . although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarcha - feminism , they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s . anarchist anthropologist david graeber and anarchist historian andrej grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism , with those " who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits " of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are " much more informed , among other elements , by indigenous , feminist , ecological and cultural - critical ideas " and who by the turn of the 21st century formed " by far the majority " of anarchists .
since the 1980s , anarchism has grown into a strong political force in latin america , with the development of fejuve ( 1979 ), cipo - rfm ( 1980s ), zapatistas ( 1994 ), horizontilidad ( 2001 ) and the oaxaca uprising ( 2006 ). around the turn of the 21st century , anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti - war , anti - capitalist , and anti - globalisation movements . anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization ( wto ), group of eight ( g8 ) and the world economic forum ( wef ). some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting , property destruction , and violent confrontations with police . these actions were precipitated by ad hoc , leaderless , anonymous cadres known as black blocs — other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture , affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet . a significant event of this period was the confrontations at wto conference in seattle in 1999 . according to anarchist scholar simon critchley , " contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo - libertarianism of contemporary neo - liberalism [...] one might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility , whether sexual , ecological or socio - economic ; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the west ravages the rest ; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality , impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally ".
international anarchist federations in existence include the international of anarchist federations , the international workers ' association and international libertarian solidarity . the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain in the form of the confederación general del trabajo ( cgt ) and the cnt . cgt membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003 .
anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the democratic federation of northern syria ( dfns ), more commonly known as rojava , a de facto autonomous region in northern syria . abdullah öcalan — a founding member of the kurdistan workers ' party ( pkk ) who is currently imprisoned in turkey — is an iconic and popular figure in the dfns whose ideas shaped the region's society and politics . while in prison , öcalan corresponded with ( and was influenced by ) murray bookchin , an anarcho - communist theorist and philosopher who developed communalism and libertarian municipalism . modelled after bookchin's ideas , öcalan developed the theory of democratic confederalism . in march 2005 , he issued his " declaration of democratic confederalism in kurdistan ", calling upon citizens " to stop attacking the government and instead create municipal assemblies , which he called ' democracy without the state '".

anarchist schools of thought

anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions , individualist anarchism and social anarchism , which have some different origins , values and evolution . the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty , i.e . opposition to state or social control over the individual , while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil , " recognising equality of entitlement ". in a chronological and theoretical sense , there are classical — those created throughout the 19th century — and post - classical anarchist schools — those created since the mid - 20th century and after .
beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism , which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it . a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate , and usually temporary , " necessary evil " but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy . one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was " anarchism without adjectives ", a call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in 1889 in response to the " bitter debates " of anarchist theory at the time . in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms ( i.e . collectivist -, communist -, mutualist - and individualist - anarchism ), it sought to emphasise the anti - authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought .

mutualism began in 18th - century english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre - joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states . proudhon proposed spontaneous order , whereby organisation emerges without central authority , a " positive anarchy " where order arises when everybody does " what he wishes and only what he wishes " and where " business transactions alone produce the social order ." proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance . for this reason , much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self - governance , proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers ' movements and , in addition to advocating state - protected charters for worker - owned cooperatives , promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service .
mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity , free association , voluntary contract , federation , and credit and currency reform . according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene , each worker in the mutualist system would receive " just and exact pay for his work ; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost , without profit or discount ". mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism . proudhon first characterised his goal as a " third form of society , the synthesis of communism and property ".

social anarchism

social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations , without any government authority or coercion . it is the largest school of thought in anarchism . social anarchism rejects private property , seeing it as a source of social inequality ( while retaining respect for personal property ) and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid .

collectivist anarchism

collectivist anarchism , also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such , is a revolutionary form of anarchism , commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most . collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production , instead advocating that ownership be collectivised . this was to be achieved through violent revolution , first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence , or propaganda by the deed , which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production .
however , collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked , rather than receiving goods being distributed " according to need " as in anarcho - communism . this position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively " uphold [ ing ] the wages system ". collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with marxism , but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society . anarchist , communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive — although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour , some held out the possibility of a post - revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need .

anarcho - communism

anarcho - communism ( also known as anarchist - communism , libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism ) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state , markets , money , private property ( while retaining respect for personal property ) and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production , direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers ' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle : " from each according to his ability , to each according to his need ".
some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism , believing anarcho - communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom . most anarcho - communists view anarcho - communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society .
anarcho - communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international . the theoretical work of peter kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro - organisationalist and insurrectionary anti - organisationalist sections . to date , the best known examples of an anarchist communist society ( i.e . established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon ), are the anarchist territories during the spanish revolution and the free territory during the russian revolution . through the efforts and influence of the spanish anarchists during the spanish revolution within the spanish civil war , starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of aragon , parts of the levante and andalusia as well as in the stronghold of anarchist catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war , hitler , mussolini , communist party of spain repression ( backed by the soviet union ) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the spanish republic itself . during the russian revolution , anarchists such as nestor makhno worked to create and defend — through the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine — anarcho - communism in the free territory of the ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the bolsheviks in 1921 .

anarcho - syndicalism

anarcho - syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement . anarcho - syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change , replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self - managed by workers . the basic principles of anarcho - syndicalism are workers ' solidarity , direct action and workers ' self - management . anarcho - syndicalists believe that only direct action — that is , action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action , such as electing a representative to a government position — will allow workers to liberate themselves . moreover , anarcho - syndicalists believe that workers ' organisations ( the organisations that struggle against the wage system , which in anarcho - syndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society ) should be self - managing . they should not have bosses or " business agents "— rather , the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves . rudolf rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho - syndicalist movement . he outlined a view of the origins of the movement , what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet anarcho - syndicalism . the international workers association is an international anarcho - syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries . the spanish cnt played and still plays a major role in the spanish labour movement . it was also an important force in the spanish civil war .

individualist anarchism

individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups , society , traditions and ideological systems . individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy , but it instead refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict .
in 1793 , william godwin , who has often been cited as the first anarchist , wrote political justice , which some consider the first expression of anarchism . godwin was a philosophical anarchist and from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present " necessary evil " that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge . godwin advocated individualism , proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good .
an influential form of individualist anarchism , called " egoism ", or egoist anarchism , was expounded by one of the earliest and best - known proponents of individualist anarchism , the german max stirner . stirner's the ego and its own , published in 1844 , is a founding text of the philosophy . according to stirner , the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire , without regard for god , state , or morality . to stirner , rights were " spooks " in the mind and he held that society does not exist , but " the individuals are its reality ". stirner advocated self - assertion and foresaw unions of egoists , non - systematic associations continually renewed by all parties ' support through an act of will , which stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state . egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals . " egoism " has inspired many interpretations of stirner's philosophy . it was re - discovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and homosexual activist john henry mackay .
josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist , and the four - page weekly paper he edited during 1833 , the peaceful revolutionist , was the first anarchist periodical published . for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster , "[ i ] t is apparent [...] that proudhonian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews [...] william b . greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form ". henry david thoreau ( 1817 – 1862 ) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe . thoreau was an american author , poet , naturalist , tax resister , development critic , surveyor , historian , philosopher and leading transcendentalist . he is best known for his books walden , a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings , as well as his essay , civil disobedience , an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state . benjamin tucker later fused stirner's egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication liberty .
from these early influences , individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals , free love and birth control advocates ( see anarchism and issues related to love and sex ), individualist naturists and nudists ( see anarcho - naturism ), freethought and anti - clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation ( see european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france ). these authors and activists included oscar wilde , emile armand , han ryner , henri zisly , renzo novatore , miguel gimenez igualada , adolf brand and lev chernyi among others .

post - classical anarchist schools of thought

anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements , at times eclectic , drawing upon various sources and syncretic , combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches .
insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory , practice , and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises insurrection within anarchist practice . it is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses . instead , insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation . insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack , permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies .
green anarchism ( or eco - anarchism ) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues , with an important precedent in anarcho - naturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho - primitivism and social ecology . writing from a green anarchist perspective , john zerzan attributes the ills of today's social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization . while layla abdelrahim argues that " the shift in human consciousness was also a shift in human subsistence strategies , whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby institutionalize violence ". thus , according to her , civilization was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics . language and literacy , she claims , are some of these technologies .
anarcha - feminism ( also called anarchist feminism and anarcho - feminism ) combines anarchism with feminism . it generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association . anarcha - feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle , and the anarchist struggle against the state . in essence , the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa . l . susan brown claims that " as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power , it is inherently feminist ". anarcha - feminism began with the late 19th - century writings of early feminist anarchists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre .
anarcho - pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change ( see non - violence ). it developed mostly in the netherlands , britain and the united states before and during the second world war . christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and christianity . its main proponents included leo tolstoy , dorothy day , ammon hennacy and jacques ellul .
religious anarchism refers to a set of related anarchist ideologies that are inspired by the teachings of ( organized ) religions , but many anarchists have traditionally been skeptical of and opposed to organized religion . many different religions have served as inspiration for religious forms of anarchism , most notably christianity as christian anarchists believe that biblical teachings give credence to anarchist philosophy . non - christian forms of religious anarchism include buddhist anarchism , jewish anarchism and most recently neopaganism .
synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives . in the 1920s , this form found as its main proponents the anarcho - communists voline and sébastien faure . it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations .
platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of dielo truda's organisational platform of the general union of anarchists ( draft ). the document was based on the experiences of russian anarchists in the 1917 october revolution , which led eventually to the victory of the bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups . the platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the russian revolution .
post - left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional left - wing politics . some post - leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality . influenced by the work of max stirner and by the marxist situationist international , post - left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation .
post - anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought , drawing from diverse ideas including post - left anarchy , postmodernism , autonomism , postcolonialism and the situationist international .
queer anarchism is a form of socialism which suggests anarchism as a solution to the issues faced by the lgbt community , mainly heteronormativity , homophobia , transphobia and biphobia . anarcho - queer arose during the late 20th century based on the work of michel foucault the history of sexuality .
left - wing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self - ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions , these ideas support strongly anti - corporatist , anti - hierarchical , pro - labour positions and anti - capitalism in economics and anti - imperialism in foreign policy .
anarcho - capitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of self - ownership in a free market . anarcho - capitalism developed from radical anti - state libertarianism and individualist anarchism , drawing from austrian school economics , study of law and economics and public choice theory . there is a strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho - capitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti - capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalist forms .
anarcho - transhumanism is a recently new branch of anarchism that takes traditional and modern anarchism , typically drawing from anarcho - syndicalism , left - libertarianism or libertarian socialism and combines it with transhumanism and post - humanism . it can be described as a " liberal democratic revolution , at its core the idea that people are happiest when they have rational control over their lives . reason , science , and technology provide one kind of control , slowly freeing us from ignorance , toil , pain , disease and limited lifespans ( aging )". some anarcho - transhumanists might also follow technogaianism .

internal issues and debates

anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes , tendencies and schools of thought and as such disagreement over questions of values , ideology and tactics is common . the compatibility of capitalism , nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed . similarly , anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism , communism , collectivism , syndicalism / trade unionism and capitalism . anarchists may be motivated by humanism , divine authority , enlightened self - interest , veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines .
phenomena such as civilisation , technology ( e.g . within anarcho - primitivism ) and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others .
on a tactical level , while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century ( e.g . the nihilist movement ), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence , counter - economics and anti - state cryptography to bring about an anarchist society . about the scope of an anarchist society , some anarchists advocate a global one , while others do so by local ones . the diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions , which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory .

topics of interest

intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought , certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory .

free love

an important current within anarchism is free love . free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to josiah warren and to experimental communities , viewed sexual freedom as a clear , direct expression of an individual's sovereignty . free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women , see for example marriage laws and anti - birth control measures . the most important american free love journal was lucifer the lightbearer ( 1883 – 1907 ), edited by moses harman and lois waisbrooker , but also there existed ezra heywood and angela heywood's the word ( 1872 – 1890 , 1892 – 1893 ). free society ( 1895 – 1897 as the firebrand ; 1897 – 1904 as free society ) was a major anarchist newspaper in the united states at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries . the publication advocated free love and women's rights and critiqued " comstockery "— i.e . censorship of sexual information . also m . e . lazarus was an important american individualist anarchist who promoted free love .
in new york city's greenwich village , bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self - realisation and pleasure for women ( and also men ) in the here and now . they encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical edna st . vincent millay and the lesbian anarchist margaret anderson were prominent among them . discussion groups organised by the villagers were frequented by emma goldman , among others . magnus hirschfeld noted in 1923 that goldman " has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights , and especially for those deprived of their rights . thus it came about that she was the first and only woman , indeed the first and only american , to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public ". before goldman , heterosexual anarchist robert reitzel ( 1849 – 1898 ) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his detroit - based german language journal der arme teufel ( english : the poor devil ). in argentina , anarcha - feminist virginia bolten published the newspaper called ( english : the woman's voice ), which was published nine times in rosario between 8 january 1896 and 1 january 1897 and was revived briefly in 1901 .
in europe , the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was emile armand . he proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults . he was also a consistent proponent of polyamory . in germany , the stirnerists adolf brand and john henry mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality . mujeres libres was an anarchist women's organisation in spain that aimed to empower working class women . it was founded in 1936 by lucía sánchez saornil , mercedes comaposada and amparo poch y gascón and had approximately 30,000 members . the organisation was based on the idea of a " double struggle " for women's liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel . in order to gain mutual support , they created networks of women anarchists . lucía sánchez saornil was a main founder of the spanish anarcha - feminist federation mujeres libres who was open about her lesbianism . she was published in a variety of literary journals while working under a male pen name , she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to censorship and punishment .
more recently , the british anarcho - pacifist alex comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual the joy of sex . the issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of french anarcho - hedonist philosopher michel onfray in such works as théorie du corps amoureux . pour une érotique solaire ( 2000 ) and l' invention du plaisir . fragments cyréaniques ( 2002 ).

libertarian education and freethought

for english anarchist william godwin , education was " the main means by which change would be achieved ". godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness . for godwin , education had to have a " respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion ", a " pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives " and a " concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school ". in his political justice , he criticises state sponsored schooling " on account of its obvious alliance with national government ". early american anarchist josiah warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established . max stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called the false principle of our education in which stirner names his educational principle " personalist ", explaining that self - understanding consists in hourly self - creation . education for him is to create " free men , sovereign characters ", by which he means " eternal characters [...] who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment ".
in the united states , freethought was a basically anti - christian , anti - clerical movement , whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters . a number of contributors to liberty ( anarchist publication ) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism . the individualist anarchist george macdonald was a co - editor of freethought and , for a time , the truth seeker . e.c . walker was co - editor of lucifer , the light - bearer and many anarchists were " ardent freethinkers ; reprints from freethought papers such as lucifer , the light - bearer , freethought and the truth seeker appeared in liberty ... the church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself ".
in 1901 , catalan anarchist and free thinker francesc ferrer i guàrdia established " modern " or progressive schools in barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church . the schools ' stated goal was to " educate the working class in a rational , secular and non - coercive setting ". fiercely anti - clerical , ferrer believed in " freedom in education ", education free from the authority of church and state . murray bookchin wrote : " this period [ 1890s ] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where anarchists exercised some degree of influence . perhaps the best - known effort in this field was francisco ferrer's modern school ( escuela moderna ), a project which exercised a considerable influence on catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally ". la escuela moderna and ferrer's ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools in the united states , cuba , south america and london . the first of these was started in new york city in 1911 . it also inspired the italian newspaper università popolare , founded in 1901 . russian christian anarchist leo tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate . tolstoy's educational experiments were short - lived due to harassment by the tsarist secret police . tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture . he thought that "[ e ] ducation is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself [...] education is culture under restraint , culture is free . [ education is ] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil , and when then instruction is exclusive , that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary ". for him , " without compulsion , education was transformed into culture ".
a more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which child - led activity replaces pedagogic approaches . experiments in germany led to a . s . neill founding what became summerhill school in 1921 . summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice . however , although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian , they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle - approach . in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles , anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se . the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich , who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self - determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead .

criticisms

moral and pragmatic criticism of anarchism includes allegations of utopianism , tacit authoritarianism , and vandalism towards feats of civilization .

allegation of utopianism

anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics , often in general and formal debate . european history professor carl landauer argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a " lesser evil " than a society without " repressive force ." he also argued that " ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears " is an " absurdity ".
anarchists often counter this assertion by arguing that it is merely a misconception . mainstream anarchism does not expect such an outcome and instead offers other , decentralized mechanisms for crime prevention and adjudication . an anarchist faq states the following : " anarchy is not a utopia [...] anarchists make no claims about human perfection [...] disputes would be solved by reasonable methods , for example , the use of juries , mutual third parties , or community and workplace assemblies [...] some sort of " court " system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens [...]".

tacit authoritarianism

the anarchist tendency known as platformism has been criticized by situationists , insurrectionaries , synthesis anarchists and others of preserving tacitly statist , authoritarian or bureaucratic tendencies . the anarcho - capitalist economist bryan caplan argues that the treatment of fascists and fascist sympathizers by spanish anarchists in the spanish civil war was a form of illegitimate coercion , making the anarchists " ultimately just a third faction of totalitarians ," alongside the communists and fascists . he also criticizes the willingness of the confederación nacional del trabajo ( cnt ) to join the republican government during the civil war , and references stanley g . payne's book on the franco regime which claims that the cnt entered negotiations with the government of spain six years after the war . many anarcho - syndicalists , anarcho - communists , and other types of anarchists have criticized the cnt - fai for entering the spanish government during and since the events of the civil war .

anarchism and civilization

in his essay on authority , friedrich engels claimed that radical decentralization promoted by anarchists would destroy modern industrial civilization , citing an example of railways :
in the end , it is argued that authority in any form is a natural occurrence which should not be abolished .

autism

autism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication , and by restricted and repetitive behavior . parents usually notice signs during the first two or three years of their child's life . these signs often develop gradually , though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace before worsening .
autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors . risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections , such as rubella , and toxins including valproic acid , alcohol , cocaine , pesticides and air pollution . controversies surround other proposed environmental causes ; for example , the vaccine hypotheses , which have been disproven . autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize ; how this occurs is not well understood . in the dsm - 5 , autism and less severe forms of the condition , including asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified ( pdd - nos ), have been combined into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder ( asd ).
early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self - care , social , and communication skills . although there is no known cure , there have been cases of children who recovered . not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood , though some are successful . an autistic culture has developed , with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder .
globally , autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people . in the 2000s , the number of people affected was estimated at 1 – 2 per 1,000 people worldwide . in the developed countries , about 1.5 % of children are diagnosed with asd , a more than doubling from 0.7 % in 2000 in the united states . it occurs four - to - five times more often in boys than girls . the number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the 1960s , partly due to changes in diagnostic practice ; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved .

characteristics

autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood , and generally follows a steady course without remission . people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal , or even superior , in others . overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months , become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood , although often in more muted form . it is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms : impairments in social interaction ; impairments in communication ; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior . other aspects , such as atypical eating , are also common but are not essential for diagnosis . individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly , without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits .

social development

social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders ( asd ; see classification ) from other developmental disorders . people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted . noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals , or people with normal neural development , as leaving her feeling " like an anthropologist on mars ".
unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood . autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli , smile and look at others less often , and respond less to their own name . autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms ; for example , they have less eye contact and turn - taking , and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves , such as pointing at things . three - to five - year - old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding , approach others spontaneously , imitate and respond to emotions , communicate nonverbally , and take turns with others . however , they do form attachments to their primary caregivers . most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children , although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd . older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions .
children with high - functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non - autistic peers , despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone . making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism . for them , the quality of friendships , not the number of friends , predicts how lonely they feel . functional friendships , such as those resulting in invitations to parties , may affect the quality of life more deeply .
there are many anecdotal reports , but few systematic studies , of aggression and violence in individuals with asd . the limited data suggest that , in children with intellectual disability , autism is associated with aggression , destruction of property , and tantrums .

communication

about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs . differences in communication may be present from the first year of life , and may include delayed onset of babbling , unusual gestures , diminished responsiveness , and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver . in the second and third years , children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling , consonants , words , and word combinations ; their gestures are less often integrated with words . children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences , and are more likely to simply repeat others ' words ( echolalia ) or reverse pronouns . joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech , and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd : for example : they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed - at object , and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience . children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language .
in a pair of studies , high - functioning children with autism aged 8 – 15 performed equally well as , and as adults better than , individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling . both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language , comprehension and inference . as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills , these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends .

repetitive behavior

autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior , which the repetitive behavior scale - revised ( rbs - r ) categorizes as follows .
stereotyped behaviors : repetitive movements , such as hand flapping , head rolling , or body rocking .
compulsive behaviors : time - consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules , such as placing objects in a specific order , checking things , or hand washing .
sameness : resistance to change ; for example , insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted .
ritualistic behavior : unvarying pattern of daily activities , such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual . this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors .
restricted interests : interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus , such as preoccupation with a single television program , toy , or game .
self - injury : behaviors such as eye - poking , skin - picking , hand - biting and head - banging .
no single repetitive or self - injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism , but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors .

other symptoms

autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis , but that can affect the individual or the family .
an estimated 0.5 % to 10 % of individuals with asd show unusual abilities , ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants . many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention , relative to the general population . sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 % of those with autism , and are considered core features by some , although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders . differences are greater for under - responsivity ( for example , walking into things ) than for over - responsivity ( for example , distress from loud noises ) or for sensation seeking ( for example , rhythmic movements ). an estimated 60 – 80 % of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone , poor motor planning , and toe walking ; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper .
unusual eating behavior occurs in about three - quarters of children with asd , to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator . selectivity is the most common problem , although eating rituals and food refusal also occur ; this does not appear to result in malnutrition . although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal symptoms , there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual ; studies report conflicting results , and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and asd is unclear .
parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress . siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship . however , they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome ; siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well - being and poorer sibling relationships as adults . there is tentative evidence that autism occurs more frequently in people with gender dysphoria .

causes

it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic , cognitive , and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms . however , there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co - occur .
autism has a strong genetic basis , although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects , or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants . complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes , the environment , and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression . many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents .
studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for asd , and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population . however , most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified . typically , autism cannot be traced to a mendelian ( single - gene ) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality , and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd . numerous candidate genes have been located , with only small effects attributable to any particular gene . most loci individually explain less than 1 % of cases of autism . the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation — such as deletions , duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis . hence , a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited : that is , the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome . autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition .
several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism . some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways , such as those involved with cell adhesion . gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity - dependent changes . all known teratogens ( agents that cause birth defects ) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception , and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later , there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development .
exposure to air pollution during pregnancy , especially heavy metals and particulates , may increase the risk of autism . environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods , infectious diseases , solvents , pcbs , phthalates and phenols used in plastic products , pesticides , brominated flame retardants , alcohol , smoking , illicit drugs , vaccines , and prenatal stress . some such as the mmr vaccine have been completely disproven .
parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination . this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine " overload ", a vaccine preservative , or the mmr vaccine for causing autism . the latter theory was supported by a litigation - funded study that has since been shown to have been " an elaborate fraud ". although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible , parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations , outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries , and the preventable deaths of several children .

mechanism

autism's symptoms result from maturation - related changes in various systems of the brain . how autism occurs is not well understood . its mechanism can be divided into two areas : the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism , and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors . the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies .

pathophysiology

unlike many other brain disorders , such as parkinson's , autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular , cellular , or systems level ; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways , or is ( like intellectual disability ) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms . autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems , and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product . neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception . this anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors . just after birth , the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual , followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood . it is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism . it seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization . hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following :
an excess of neurons that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions .
disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation .
unbalanced excitatory – inhibitory networks .
abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines , for example , by modulation of the neurexin – neuroligin cell - adhesion system , or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic proteins . disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy , which may explain why the two conditions are associated .
the immune system is thought to play an important role in autism . children with autism have been found by researchers to have inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines and significant activation of microglia . biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as , deficits in social interactions and communication . interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life , and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response . it is thought that activation of a pregnant mother's immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development . this is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism .
the relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood ; several have been investigated , with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport . the role of group i metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mglur ) in the pathogenesis of fragile x syndrome , the most common identified genetic cause of autism , has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway . some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors . also , some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism , but probably account for less than 5 % of cases .
the mirror neuron system ( mns ) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties . the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action . the mns may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions , intentions , and emotions . several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in mns regions of individuals with asd , delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with asperger syndrome , and a correlation between reduced mns activity and severity of the syndrome in children with asd . however , individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the mns and the mns theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object .
asd - related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks .
in autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network ( a large - scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing ), with intact connectivity of the task - positive network ( used in sustained attention and goal - directed thinking ). in people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time , suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks , possibly reflecting a disturbance of self - referential thought .
the underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high - level neural connections and synchronization , along with an excess of low - level processes . evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with asd have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex . other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex .
from studies based on event - related potentials , transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli , there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention , orientation to auditory and visual stimuli , novelty detection , language and face processing , and information storage ; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli . for example , magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals .
in the genetic area , relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes ; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 1q21.1 deletion syndrome . research on autism / schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 ( 15q13.3 ), chromosome 16 ( 16p13.1 ) and chromosome 17 ( 17p12 ) are inconclusive .
functional connectivity studies have found both hypo - and hyper - connectivity in brains of people with autism . hypo - connectivity seems to dominate , especially for interhemispheric and cortico - cortical functional connectivity .

neuropsychology

two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior .
the first category focuses on deficits in social cognition . simon baron - cohen's empathizing – systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize — that is , they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain — but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents . an extension , the extreme male brain theory , hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain , defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing . these theories are somewhat related to baron - cohen's earlier theory of mind approach , which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others . the theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the sally – anne test for reasoning about others ' motivations , and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis . however , most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals ; instead , data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others ' viewpoints .
the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing : the executive functions such as working memory , planning , inhibition . in his review , kenworthy states that " the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial ", however , " it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism ". tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence , but performance never reaches typical adult levels . a strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests ; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism .
weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism . one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people . a related theory — enhanced perceptual functioning — focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals . yet another , monotropism , posits that autism stems from a different cognitive style , tending to focus attention ( or processing resources ) intensely , to the exclusion of other stimuli . these theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism .
neither category is satisfactory on its own ; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors , while most of the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties . a combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful .

diagnosis

diagnosis is based on behavior , not cause or mechanism . under the dsm - 5 , autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts , as well as restricted , repetitive patterns of behavior , interests , or activities . these deficits are present in early childhood , typically before age three , and lead to clinically significant functional impairment . sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity , stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language , and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects . the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome , intellectual disability or global developmental delay . icd - 10 uses essentially the same definition .
several diagnostic instruments are available . two are commonly used in autism research : the autism diagnostic interview - revised ( adi - r ) is a semistructured parent interview , and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ( ados ) uses observation and interaction with the child . the childhood autism rating scale ( cars ) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children . the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders ( disco ) may also be used .
a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child . if warranted , diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists , observing and assessing cognitive , communication , family , and other factors using standardized tools , and taking into account any associated medical conditions . a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills , both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions . a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability , hearing impairment , and a specific language impairment such as landau – kleffner syndrome . the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression .
clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed , particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause . although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40 % of cases to genetic causes , consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high - resolution chromosome and fragile x testing . a genotype - first model of diagnosis has been proposed , which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations . as new genetic tests are developed several ethical , legal , and social issues will emerge . commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results , given the complexity of autism's genetics . metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful , but are not routine .
asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months , although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life : for example , a one - year - old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three - year - old to continue to do so a few years later . in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment , though few cases are handled that quickly in practice . although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood , they are sometimes missed ; years later , adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves , to help their employers make adjustments , or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits . girls are often diagnosed later than boys .
underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases , and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices . the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd , resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms . conversely , the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis . it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired , partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision , and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms .

classification

autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders ( pdd ), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication , and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior . these symptoms do not imply sickness , fragility , or emotional disturbance .
of the five pdd forms , asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes ; rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism , but may have unrelated causes ; pdd not otherwise specified ( pdd - nos ; also called atypical autism ) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder . unlike with autism , people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development . the terminology of autism can be bewildering , with autism , asperger syndrome and pdd - nos often called the autism spectrum disorders ( asd ) or sometimes the autistic disorders , whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder , childhood autism , or infantile autism . in this article , autism refers to the classic autistic disorder ; in clinical practice , though , autism , asd , and pdd are often used interchangeably . asd , in turn , is a subset of the broader autism phenotype , which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic - like traits , such as avoiding eye contact .
the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum , ranging from individuals with severe impairments — who may be silent , developmentally disabled , and locked into hand flapping and rocking — to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches , narrowly focused interests , and verbose , pedantic communication . because the behavior spectrum is continuous , boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary . sometimes the syndrome is divided into low -, medium - or high - functioning autism ( lfa , mfa , and hfa ), based on iq thresholds , or on how much support the individual requires in daily life ; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial . autism can also be divided into syndromal and non - syndromal autism ; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms , such as tuberous sclerosis . although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism , the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome , hfa , and non - syndromal autism is unclear .
some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills , as opposed to a failure to make progress , typically from 15 to 30 months of age . the validity of this distinction remains controversial ; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype , or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression .
research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry , psychology , neurology and pediatrics . newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes ( observable traits ) that can be viewed on brain scans , to help further neurogenetic studies of autism ; one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain , which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects . it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior .

screening

about half of parents of children with asd notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months , and about four - fifths notice by age 24 months . according to an article , failure to meet any of the following milestones " is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations . delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long - term outcome ".
no babbling by 12 months .
no gesturing ( pointing , waving , etc .) by 12 months .
no single words by 16 months .
no two - word ( spontaneous , not just echolalic ) phrases by 24 months .
any loss of any language or social skills , at any age .
the united states preventive services task force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns . the japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at 18 and 24 months , using autism - specific formal screening tests . in contrast , in the uk , children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened . it is not known which approach is more effective . screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers ( m - chat ), the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire , and the first year inventory ; initial data on m - chat and its predecessor , the checklist for autism in toddlers ( chat ), on children aged 18 – 30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity ( many false - negatives ) but good specificity ( few false - positives ). it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders . screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture . although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical , it can be considered in some cases , such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features .

prevention

while infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1 % of cases of autism , vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases .

management

the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress , and to increase quality of life and functional independence . in general , higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes . no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs . families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment . services should be carried out by behavior analysts , special education teachers , speech pathologists , and licensed psychologists . studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy . however , the development of evidence - based interventions has advanced in recent years . although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence , suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment , the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor , their clinical results are mostly tentative , and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options . intensive , sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self - care , communication , and job skills , and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors ; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated . while medications have not been found to help with core symptoms , they may be used for associated symptoms , such as irritability , inattention , or repetitive behavior patterns .

education

educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis ( aba ), developmental models , structured teaching , speech and language therapy , social skills therapy , and occupational therapy . among these approaches , interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively , or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit . the quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention ( eibi )— a treatment procedure encompassing over thirty hours per week of the structured type of aba that is carried out with very young children — is currently low , and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed . two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic aba interventions , and developmental social pragmatic models ( dsp ). one interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model , which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques , allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves . various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at - home parent implementation . despite the recent development of parent training models , these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies , being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment .
early , intensive aba therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children , and is well - established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group . similarly , a teacher - implemented intervention that utilizes a more naturalistic form of aba combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social - communication skills in young children , although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms . neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators , resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided . it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up , and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results . the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers .

medication

medications may be used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails . they may also be used for associated health problems , such as adhd or anxiety . more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants , with the most common drug classes being antidepressants , stimulants , and antipsychotics . the atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are fda - approved for treating associated aggressive and self - injurious behaviors . however , their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits , and people with autism may respond atypically . side effects , for example , may include weight gain , tiredness , drooling , and aggression . ssri antidepressants , such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine , have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors , while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with co - morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity . there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd . no known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments . experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function , suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism .

alternative medicine

although many alternative therapies and interventions are available , few are supported by scientific studies . treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality - of - life contexts , and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real - world relevance . some alternative treatments may place the child at risk . a 2008 study found that compared to their peers , autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein - free diets ; in 2005 , botched chelation therapy killed a five - year - old child with autism . another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is cease therapy , a mixture of homeopathy , supplements , and ' vaccine detoxing '.
although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism , there is no good evidence that a gluten - free diet is of benefit . in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors . there is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions , verbal communication , and non - verbal communication skills . there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism .

society and culture

the emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism . through this movement , people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease . proponents of this movement wish to seek " acceptance , not cures ." there have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as world autism awareness day , light it up blue , autism sunday , autistic pride day , autreat , and others . there have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone's life . these organizations include autism speaks , autism national committee , autism society of america , and many others . social - science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about " autism as a culture , transcultural comparisons ... and research on social movements ." media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism . rain man , a film that won 4 oscars including best picture , depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities . while many autistic individuals do not have these special abilities , some have been successful in their fields .

cost

treatment is expensive ; indirect costs are more so . for someone born in 2000 , a us study estimated an average lifetime cost of ( net present value in dollars , inflation - adjusted from 2003 estimate ), with about 10 % medical care , 30 % extra education and other care , and 60 % lost economic productivity . publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child , and unreimbursed out - of - pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems ; one 2008 us study found a 14 % average loss of annual income in families of children with asd , and a related study found that asd is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment . us states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services , shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance . after childhood , key treatment issues include residential care , job training and placement , sexuality , social skills , and estate planning .

prognosis

there is no known cure . children recover occasionally , so that they lose their diagnosis of asd ; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not . it is not known how often recovery happens ; reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from 3 % to 25 %. most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger , though a few have developed communication skills in later years . most children with autism lack social support , meaningful relationships , future employment opportunities or self - determination . although core difficulties tend to persist , symptoms often become less severe with age .
few high - quality studies address long - term prognosis . some adults show modest improvement in communication skills , but a few decline ; no study has focused on autism after midlife . acquiring language before age six , having an iq above 50 , and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes ; independent living is unlikely with severe autism . most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood .

epidemiology

most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1 – 2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for asd , and 11 per 1,000 children in the united states for asd as of 2008 ; because of inadequate data , these numbers may underestimate asd's true rate . globally , autism affects an estimated 24.8 million people , while asperger syndrome affects a further 37.2 million . in 2012 , the nhs estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the uk was 1.1 %. rates of pdd - nos's has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000 , asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000 , and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000 . cdc's most recent estimate is that 1 out of every 68 children , or 14.7 per 1,000 , has an asd as of 2010 .
the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s . this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices , referral patterns , availability of services , age at diagnosis , and public awareness , though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out . the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased ; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics .
boys are at higher risk for asd than girls . the sex ratio averages 4.3 : 1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment : it may be close to 2 : 1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5 : 1 without . several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated , but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed ; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed .
although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy - related risk factor as a cause of autism , the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent , and with diabetes , bleeding , and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy . the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers ; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm , and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism . most professionals believe that race , ethnicity , and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism .
several other conditions are common in children with autism . they include :
genetic disorders . about 10 – 15 % of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian ( single - gene ) condition , chromosome abnormality , or other genetic syndrome , and asd is associated with several genetic disorders .
intellectual disability . the percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25 % to 70 %, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing intelligence of individuals on the autism spectrum . in comparison , for pdd - nos the association with intellectual disability is much weaker , and by definition , the diagnosis of asperger's excludes intellectual disability .
anxiety disorders are common among children with asd ; there are no firm data , but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11 % to 84 %. many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself , or are hard to distinguish from asd's symptoms .
epilepsy , with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age , cognitive level , and type of language disorder .
several metabolic defects , such as phenylketonuria , are associated with autistic symptoms .
minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population .
preempted diagnoses . although the dsm - iv rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism , the full criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ), tourette syndrome , and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted .
sleep problems affect about two - thirds of individuals with asd at some point in childhood . these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep , frequent nocturnal awakenings , and early morning awakenings . sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress , and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis .

history

a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named . the table talk of martin luther , compiled by his notetaker , mathesius , contains the story of a 12 - year - old boy who may have been severely autistic . luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil , and suggested that he be suffocated , although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report . the earliest well - documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue , as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair's marriage to gain blair's inheritance . the wild boy of aveyron , a feral child caught in 1798 , showed several signs of autism ; the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation .
the new latin word autismus ( english translation autism ) was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia . he derived it from the greek word autós ( αὐτόσ , meaning " self "), and used it to mean morbid self - admiration , referring to " autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies , against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance ". a soviet child psychiatrist , grunya sukhareva , described a similar syndrome that was published in russian in 1925 , and in german in 1926 .

clinical development and diagnoses

the word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler's terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology . asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome , though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981 . leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities . almost all the characteristics described in kanner's first paper on the subject , notably " autistic aloneness " and " insistence on sameness ", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders . it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger .
donald triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism . he was diagnosed by kanner after being first examined in 1938 , and was labeled as " case 1 ". triplett was noted for his savant abilities , particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers . his father , oliver , described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns , music notes , letters of the alphabet , and u.s . president pictures . by the age of 2 , he had the ability to recite the 23rd psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the presbyterian catechism . he was also interested in creating musical chords .
kanner's reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia , and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to " refrigerator mothers ". starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome .

terminology and distinction from schizophrenia

as late as the mid - 1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism ; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions . although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have affected how asd is viewed , parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively , and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research .
it took until 1980 for the dsm - iii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia . in 1987 , the dsm - iii - r provided a checklist for diagnosing autism . in may 2013 , the dsm - 5 was released , updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders . the grouping of disorders , including pdd - nos , autism , asperger syndrome , rett syndrome , and cdd , has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders . the two categories that exist are impaired social communication and / or interaction , and restricted and / or repetitive behaviors .
the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with , and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely . societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed : some in the community seek a cure , while others believe that autism is simply another way of being .

albedo
albedo () (, meaning ' whiteness ') is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation received by an astronomical body ( e.g . a planet like earth ). it is dimensionless and measured on a scale from 0 ( corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation ) to 1 ( corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation ).
surface albedo is defined as the ratio of irradiance reflected to the irradiance received by a surface . the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself , but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earth's surface . these factors vary with atmospheric composition , geographic location and time ( see position of the sun ). while bi - hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence ( i.e ., for a given position of the sun ), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period . the temporal resolution may range from seconds ( as obtained from flux measurements ) to daily , monthly , or annual averages .
unless given for a specific wavelength ( spectral albedo ), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation . due to measurement constraints , it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface ( between 0.3 and 3 μm ). this spectrum includes visible light ( 0.39 – 0.7 μm ), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark ( e.g ., trees absorb most radiation ), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright ( e.g ., snow reflects most radiation ).
albedo is an important concept in climatology , astronomy , and environmental management ( e.g ., as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design ( leed ) program for sustainable rating of buildings ). the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere , its planetary albedo , is 30 – 35 % because of cloud cover , but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features .
the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 1760 work photometria .

terrestrial albedo

any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal , one of the darkest substances . deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body . when seen from a distance , the ocean surface has a low albedo , as do most forests , whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms . most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4 . the average albedo of earth is about 0.3 . this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds .
earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa's modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites , and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss . as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite , not all directions , a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional - hemispherical reflectance and bi - hemispherical reflectance ( e.g .,). these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( brdf ), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle . bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo .
earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15 ° c . if earth were frozen entirely ( and hence be more reflective ), the average temperature of the planet would drop below 40 ° c . if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers , the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 ° c . in contrast , if the entire earth was covered by water — a so - called aquaplanet — the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27 ° c .

white - sky and black - sky albedo

for land surfaces , it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle θ' i can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms : the directional - hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle , , and the bi - hemispherical reflectance , , with being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle , and being the proportion of diffuse illumination .
hence , the actual albedo ( also called blue - sky albedo ) can then be given as :
:
directional - hemispherical reflectance is sometimes referred to as black - sky albedo and bi - hemispherical reflectance as white - sky albedo . these terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface .

astronomical albedo

the albedos of planets , satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties . the study of albedos , their dependence on wavelength , lighting angle (" phase angle "), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry . for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes , much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos . for example , the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects , the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties , whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids .
enceladus , a moon of saturn , has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system , with 99 % of em radiation reflected . another notable high - albedo body is eris , with an albedo of 0.96 . many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0.05 . a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0.04 . such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds .
the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around 0.136 , but it is strongly directional and non - lambertian , displaying also a strong opposition effect . although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains , they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies .
two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the ( v - band ) geometric albedo ( measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer ) and the bond albedo ( measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected ). their values can differ significantly , which is a common source of confusion .

in detailed studies , the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi - empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle , including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces .
the correlation between astronomical ( geometric ) albedo , absolute magnitude and diameter is :

where is the astronomical albedo , is the diameter in kilometers , and is the absolute magnitude .

examples of terrestrial albedo effects


illumination

albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light , except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the earth's surface at that location ( e.g . through albedo - temperature feedback ). that said , albedo and illumination both vary by latitude . albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics , with a local maximum in the tropics .

insolation effects

the intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation ( solar irradiance ); high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation , where areas such as the sahara desert , which also have a relatively high albedo , will be hotter due to high insolation . tropical and sub - tropical rainforest areas have low albedo , and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts , which have lower insolation . because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo , high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes .
arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb , effectively cooling the earth . this has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures , creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker ( being water or ground which is darker color ) and reflects less heat back into space . this feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect .

climate and weather

albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs . the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land , ice , or ocean surfaces can drive weather .

albedo – temperature feedback

when an area's albedo changes due to snowfall , a snow – temperature feedback results . a layer of snowfall increases local albedo , reflecting away sunlight , leading to local cooling . in principle , if no outside temperature change affects this area ( e.g ., a warm air mass ), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall , deepening the snow – temperature feedback . however , because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons , eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight ( higher insolation ) cause melting . when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo , such as grass or soil , the effect is reversed : the darkening surface lowers albedo , increasing local temperatures , which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further , resulting in still more heating .

snow

snow albedo is highly variable , ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow , to about 0.4 for melting snow , and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow . over antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8 . if a marginally snow - covered area warms , snow tends to melt , lowering the albedo , and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack ( the ice – albedo positive feedback ).
just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow , the albedo of snow - covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water . sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow . when sea ice melts , either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above , the snow - covered surface is reduced , and more surface of sea water is exposed , so the rate of energy absorption increases . the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water , which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts . as with the preceding example of snowmelt , the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback . both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important to the modern theory of global warming .
cryoconite , powdery windblown dust containing soot , sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets .
the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback , together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo , can lead to large errors in energy estimates . because of this , in order to reduce the error of energy estimates , it is important to measure the albedo of snow - covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions .

small - scale effects

albedo works on a smaller scale , too . in sunlight , dark clothes absorb more heat and light - coloured clothes reflect it better , thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing .

solar photovoltaic effects

albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices . for example , the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon ( a - si:h ) and crystalline silicon ( c - si )- based compared to traditional spectral - integrated albedo predictions . research showed impacts of over 10 %. more recently , the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials ( both human - made and natural ) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies : industrial ( solar farms ), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched - roof applications .

trees

because forests generally have a low albedo , ( the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis ), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation ( or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation ). in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect . trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration . the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface , causes heating where it condenses , acts a strong greenhouse gas , and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact , and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate
in seasonally snow - covered zones , winter albedos of treeless areas are 10 % to 50 % higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily . deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15 .
studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative ( generally warming ) effect of albedo change and ( cooling ) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests . they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool ; new forests in high latitudes ( e.g ., siberia ) were neutral or perhaps warming .

water

water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials . the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations ( see graph ).
at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner ( not diffusely ). the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this . at small angles of incident light , waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity - vs .- incident - angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle .
although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light , it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator ( early morning , late afternoon , and near the poles ). however , as mentioned above , waviness causes an appreciable reduction . because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer , water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light .
note that white caps on waves look white ( and have high albedo ) because the water is foamed up , so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect , adding up their reflectivities . fresh ' black ' ice exhibits fresnel reflection .
snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9 .

clouds

cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures . different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity , theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8 . " on any given day , about half of earth is covered by clouds , which reflect more sunlight than land and water . clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight , but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth ."
albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds , such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic . a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 ° c colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies .

aerosol effects

aerosols ( very fine particles / droplets in the atmosphere ) have both direct and indirect effects on earth's radiative balance . the direct ( albedo ) effect is generally to cool the planet ; the indirect effect ( the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties ) is less certain . as per the effects are :
aerosol direct effect . aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation . the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling , whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming .
aerosol indirect effect . aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei . increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations , which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo , increased light scattering and radiative cooling ( first indirect effect ), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud ( second indirect effect ).

black carbon

another albedo - related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles . the size of this effect is difficult to quantify : the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is 0.2 w m 2 , with a range 0.1 to 0.4 w m 2 . black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo .

human activities

human activities ( e.g ., deforestation , farming , and urbanization ) change the albedo of various areas around the globe . however , quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult .

other types of albedo

single - scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles . it depends on properties of the material ( refractive index ); the size of the particle or particles ; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation .

a
a ( named , plural as , a's , as , a's or aes ) is the first letter and the first vowel of the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet . it is similar to the ancient greek letter alpha , from which it derives . the uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle , crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar . the lowercase version can be written in two forms : the double - storey a and single - storey ɑ . the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it , especially fonts intended to be read by children , and is also found in italic type .

history

the earliest certain ancestor of " a " is aleph ( also written ' aleph ), the first letter of the phoenician alphabet , which consisted entirely of consonants ( for that reason , it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet ). in turn , the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto - sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs , styled as a triangular head with two horns extended .
by 1600 bc , the phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms . its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the hebrew or arabic aleph .
when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet , they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop — the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages , and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter — so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha . in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages , dating to the 8th century bc , the letter rests upon its side , but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter , although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg , or by the angle at which the cross line is set .
the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged . the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language , and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages , including english .

typographic variants

during roman times , there were many variant forms of the letter " a ". first was the monumental or lapidary style , which was used when inscribing on stone or other " permanent " media . there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing , which was done on more perishable surfaces . due to the " perishable " nature of these surfaces , there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental , but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive , such as majuscule cursive , minuscule cursive , and semicursive minuscule . variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles . the known variants include the early semi - uncial , the uncial , and the later semi - uncial .
typographic variants include a double - storey a and single - storey ɑ.at the end of the roman empire ( 5th century ad ), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe . among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy , the merovingian script in france , the visigothic script in spain , and the insular or anglo - irish semi - uncial or anglo - saxon majuscule of great britain . by the 9th century , the caroline script , which was very similar to the present - day form , was the principal form used in book - making , before the advent of the printing press . this form was derived through a combining of prior forms .
15th - century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today . these variants , the italic and roman forms , were derived from the caroline script version . the italic form , also called script a , is used in most current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke . this slowly developed from the fifth - century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers . the roman form is used in most printed material ; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it (" a "). both derive from the majuscule ( capital ) form . in greek handwriting , it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop , as demonstrated by the uncial version shown . many fonts then made the right leg vertical . in some of these , the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc , resulting in the printed form , while in others it was dropped , resulting in the modern handwritten form .
italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest ( set in roman type ). there are some other cases aside from italic type where script a (" ɑ "), also called latin alpha , is used in contrast with latin " a " ( such as in the international phonetic alphabet ).

use in writing systems


english

in modern english orthography , the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds :
the near - open front unrounded vowel as in pad ;
the open back unrounded vowel as in father , which is closer to its original latin and greek sound ;
the diphthong as in ace and major ( usually when is followed by one , or occasionally two , consonants and then another vowel letter ) – this results from middle english lengthening followed by the great vowel shift ;
the modified form of the above sound that occurs before , as in square and mary ;
the rounded vowel of water ;
the shorter rounded vowel ( not present in general american ) in was and what ;
a schwa , in many unstressed syllables , as in about , comma , solar .
the double sequence does not occur in native english words , but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as aaron and aardvark . however , occurs in many common digraphs , all with their own sound or sounds , particularly , , , , and .
is the third - most - commonly used letter in english ( after and ), and the second most common in spanish and french . in one study , on average , about 3.68 % of letters used in english texts tend to be , while the number is 6.22 % in spanish and 3.95 % in french .

other languages

in most languages that use the latin alphabet , denotes an open unrounded vowel , such as , , or . an exception is saanich , in which ( and the glyph á ) stands for a close - mid front unrounded vowel .

other systems

in phonetic and phonemic notation :
in the international phonetic alphabet , is used for the open front unrounded vowel , is used for the open central unrounded vowel , and is used for the open back unrounded vowel .
in x - sampa , is used for the open front unrounded vowel and is used for the open back unrounded vowel .

other uses

in algebra , the letter a along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities , whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet ( x , y , z ) are used to denote unknown quantities .
in geometry , capital a , b , c etc . are used to denote segments , lines , rays , etc . a capital a is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle , the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle a .
" a " is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status : a -, a or a , the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students ' schoolwork ; " a grade " for clean restaurants ; a - list celebrities , etc . such associations can have a motivating effect , as exposure to the letter a has been found to improve performance , when compared with other letters .
" a " is used as a prefix on some words , such as asymmetry , to mean " not " or " without " ( from greek ).
finally , the letter a is used to denote size , as in a narrow size shoe , or a small cup size in a brassiere .

alabama
alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the united states . it is bordered by tennessee to the north , georgia to the east , florida and the gulf of mexico to the south , and mississippi to the west . alabama is the 30th largest by area and the 24th - most populous of the u.s . states . with a total of of inland waterways , alabama has among the most of any state .
alabama is nicknamed the yellowhammer state , after the state bird . alabama is also known as the " heart of dixie " and the " cotton state ". the state tree is the longleaf pine , and the state flower is the camellia . alabama's capital is montgomery . the largest city by population is birmingham , which has long been the most industrialized city ; the largest city by land area is huntsville . the oldest city is mobile , founded by french colonists in 1702 as the capital of french louisiana .
from the american civil war until world war ii , alabama , like many states in the southern u.s ., suffered economic hardship , in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture . similar to other former slave states , alabamian legislators employed jim crow laws to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against african americans from the end of the reconstruction era up until at least the 1970s . despite the growth of major industries and urban centers , white rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s . during this time , urban interests and african americans were markedly under - represented . following world war ii , alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests . the state's economy in the 21st century is based on management , automotive , finance , manufacturing , aerospace , mineral extraction , healthcare , education , retail , and technology .

etymology

the european - american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people , a muskogean - speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river . in the alabama language , the word for a person of alabama lineage is albaamo ( or variously albaama or albàamo in different dialects ; the plural form is albaamaha ). the suggestion that " alabama " was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely . the word's spelling varies significantly among historical sources . the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of 1540 : garcilaso de la vega used alibamo , while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu , respectively , in transliterations of the term . as early as 1702 , the french called the tribe the alibamon , with french maps identifying the river as rivière des alibamons . other spellings of the name have included alibamu , alabamo , albama , alebamon , alibama , alibamou , alabamu , allibamou .
sources disagree on the word's meaning . some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw alba ( meaning " plants " or " weeds ") and amo ( meaning " to cut ", " to trim ", or " to gather "). the meaning may have been " clearers of the thicket " or " herb gatherers ", referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants . the state has numerous place names of native american origin . however , there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language .
an 1842 article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant " here we rest ." this notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of alexander beaufort meek . experts in the muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation .

history


pre - european settlement

indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of european colonization . trade with the northeastern tribes by the ohio river began during the burial mound period ( 1000 bc – ad 700 ) and continued until european contact .
the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 ad , with one of its major centers built at what is now the moundville archaeological site in moundville , alabama . this is the second - largest complex of the classic middle mississippian era , after cahokia in present - day illinois , which was the center of the culture . analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars ' formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex ( secc ). contrary to popular belief , the secc appears to have no direct links to mesoamerican culture , but developed independently . the ceremonial complex represents a major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples ; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood .
among the historical tribes of native american people living in present - day alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee , an iroquoian language people ; and the muskogean - speaking alabama ( alibamu ), chickasaw , choctaw , creek , and koasati . while part of the same large language family , the muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages .

european settlement

with exploration in the 16th century , the spanish were the first europeans to reach alabama . the expedition of hernando de soto passed through mabila and other parts of the state in 1540 . more than 160 years later , the french founded the region's first european settlement at old mobile in 1702 . the city was moved to the current site of mobile in 1711 . this area was claimed by the french from 1702 to 1763 as part of la louisiane .
after the french lost to the british in the seven years ' war , it became part of british west florida from 1763 to 1783 . after the united states victory in the american revolutionary war , the territory was divided between the united states and spain . the latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to u.s . forces on april 13 , 1813 .
thomas bassett , a loyalist to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era , was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile . he settled in the tombigbee district during the early 1770s . the district's boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the tombigbee river and included portions of what is today southern clarke county , northernmost mobile county , and most of washington county .
what is now the counties of baldwin and mobile became part of spanish west florida in 1783 , part of the independent republic of west florida in 1810 , and was finally added to the mississippi territory in 1812 . most of what is now the northern two - thirds of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period . it was claimed by the province of georgia from 1767 onwards . following the revolutionary war , it remained a part of georgia , although heavily disputed .
with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands , what is now the lower one - third alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in 1798 . the yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804 , following the yazoo land scandal . spain kept a claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the adams – onís treaty officially ceded it to the united states in 1819 .

early 19th century

before mississippi's admission to statehood on december 10 , 1817 , the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory . the united states congress created the alabama territory on march 3 , 1817 . st . stephens , now abandoned , served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819 .
alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on december 14 , 1819 , with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention . from july 5 to august 2 , 1819 , delegates met to prepare the new state constitution . huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820 , when the seat of government moved to cahaba in dallas county .
cahaba , now a ghost town , was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825 . the alabama fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the union , with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation . part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s , its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men .
southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded . the economy of the central black belt ( named for its dark , productive soil ) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners ' wealth grew mainly from slave labor . the area also drew many poor , disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers . alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810 , but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830 . most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in 1830 .
from 1826 to 1846 , tuscaloosa served as alabama's capital . on january 30 , 1846 , the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery . the first legislative session in the new capital met in december 1847 . a new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia . the first structure burned down in 1849 , but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851 . this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day . it was designed by barachias holt of exeter , maine .

civil war and reconstruction

by 1860 , the population had increased to 964,201 people , of which nearly half , 435,080 , were enslaved african americans , and 2,690 were free people of color . on january 11 , 1861 , alabama declared its secession from the union . after remaining an independent republic for a few days , it joined the confederate states of america . the confederacy's capital was initially at montgomery . alabama was heavily involved in the american civil war . although comparatively few battles were fought in the state , alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort .
a company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville , alabama , joined nathan bedford forrest's battalion in hopkinsville , kentucky . the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves , collar and coat tails . this led to them being greeted with " yellowhammer ", and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army .
alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th amendment in 1865 . alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may 1865 until its official restoration to the union in 1868 . from 1867 to 1874 , with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised , many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state . alabama was represented in congress during this period by three african - american congressmen : jeremiah haralson , benjamin s . turner , and james t . rapier .
following the war , the state remained chiefly agricultural , with an economy tied to cotton . during reconstruction , state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 that created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights . legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects , although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation . organized insurgent , resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans . besides the short - lived original ku klux klan , these included the pale faces , knights of the white camellia , red shirts , and the white league .
reconstruction in alabama ended in 1874 , when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence . they wrote another constitution in 1875 , and the legislature passed the blaine amendment , prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious - affiliated schools . the same year , legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools . railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891 . after disfranchising most african americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution , the alabama legislature passed more jim crow laws at the beginning of the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life .

20th century

the new 1901 constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population , including nearly all african americans and native americans , and tens of thousands of poor whites , through making voter registration difficult , requiring a poll tax and literacy test . the 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools . by 1903 , only 2,980 african americans were registered in alabama , although at least 74,000 were literate . this compared to more than 181,000 african americans eligible to vote in 1900 . the numbers dropped even more in later decades . the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s : jails were segregated in 1911 ; hospitals in 1915 ; toilets , hotels , and restaurants in 1928 ; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945 .
while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting , the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well , due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax . by 1941 , whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws : 600,000 whites vs . 520,000 african - americans . nearly all african americans had lost the ability to vote . despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions , the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement . the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens .
the rural - dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans , but it did not relieve them of paying taxes . partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south , the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools . in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds , which paid one - third of the construction costs . the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest . black residents effectively taxed themselves twice , by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools , which were built in many rural areas . they often donated land and labor as well .
beginning in 1913 , the first 80 rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african - american children . a total of 387 schools , seven teachers ' houses , and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state . several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places .
continued racial discrimination and lynchings , agricultural depression , and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the great migration out of the south . reflecting this emigration , the population growth rate in alabama ( see " historical populations " table below ) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920 .
at the same time , many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs . birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the " magic city ". by 1920 , birmingham was the 36th - largest city in the united states . heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy . its residents were under - represented for decades in the state legislature , which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes , as it was required by the state constitution . this did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order .
industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war . rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living . one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile . between 1940 and 1943 , more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war - related industries . cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base .
despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961 , the rural - dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population , as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses . they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas . one result was that jefferson county , containing birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse , contributed more than one - third of all tax revenue to the state , but did not receive a proportional amount in services . urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature . a 1960 study noted that because of rural domination , " a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature ."
in the united states supreme court cases of baker v . carr ( 1962 ) and reynolds v . sims ( 1964 ), the court ruled ruled that the principle of " one man , one vote " needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well , and that their districts had to be based on population , rather than geographic counties , as alabama had used for its senate .
in 1972 , for the first time since 1901 , the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census . this benefited the urban areas that had developed , as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years . other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts .
african americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement , including legal challenges . in 1954 , the us supreme court ruled in brown v . board of education that public schools had to be desegregated , but alabama was slow to comply . during the 1960s , under governor george wallace , alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation . the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama , including the montgomery bus boycott ( 1955 – 56 ), freedom rides in 1961 , and 1965 selma to montgomery marches . these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 by the u.s . congress .
legal segregation ended in the states in 1964 , but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court . according to the new york times , by 2017 , many of alabama's african - americans were living in alabama's cities such as birmingham and montgomery . also , the black belt region across central alabama " is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly african - american . these counties include dallas , lowndes , marengo and perry ."
alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation . in the 1980s , an omnibus redistricting case , dillard v . crenshaw county , challenged the at - large voting for representative seats of 180 alabama jurisdictions , including counties and school boards . at - large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county , as the majority tended to take all seats . despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state , they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at - large jurisdictions .
as part of settlement of this case , five alabama cities and counties , including chilton county , adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi - seat jurisdictions . this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters . in another form of proportional representation , 23 jurisdictions use limited voting , as in conecuh county . in 1982 , limited voting was first tested in conecuh county . together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices , resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens .

ancestry

according to the 2010 census , alabama had a population of 4,779,736 . the racial composition of the state was 68.5 % white ( 67.0 % non - hispanic white and 1.5 % hispanic white ), 26.2 % black or african american , 3.9 % hispanic or latino of any race , 1.1 % asian , 0.6 % american indian and alaska native , 0.1 % native hawaiian and other pacific islander , 2.0 % from some other race , and 1.5 % from two or more races . in 2011 , 46.6 % of alabama's population younger than age 1 were minorities .
the largest reported ancestry groups in alabama are : african ( 26.2 %), english ( 23.6 %), irish ( 7.7 %), german ( 5.7 %), and scots - irish ( 2.0 %). those citing " american " ancestry in alabama are generally of english or british ancestry ; many anglo - americans identify as having american ancestry because their roots have been in north america for so long , in some cases since the 1600s . demographers estimate that a minimum of 20 – 23 % of people in alabama are of predominantly english ancestry and that the figure is likely higher . in the 1980 census , 41 % of the people in alabama identified as being of english ancestry , making them the largest ethnic group at the time .
based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states , demographers estimated there are more people in alabama of scots - irish origins than self - reported . many people in alabama claim irish ancestry because of the term scots - irish but , based on historic immigration and settlement , their ancestors were more likely protestant scots - irish coming from northern ireland , where they had been for a few generations as part of the english colonization . the scots - irish were the largest non - english immigrant group from the british isles before the american revolution , and many settled in the south , later moving into the deep south as it was developed .
in 1984 , under the davis – strong act , the state legislature established the alabama indian affairs commission . native american groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination . given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation , the native american peoples , who have sometimes been of mixed race , have insisted on having their cultural identification respected . in the past , their self - identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black .
the state has officially recognized nine american indian tribes in the state , descended mostly from the five civilized tribes of the american southeast . these are :
poarch band of creek indians ( who also have federal recognition ),
mowa band of choctaw indians ,

echota cherokee tribe of alabama ,
cherokee tribe of northeast alabama ,
cher - o - creek intra tribal indians ,
ma - chis lower creek indian tribe ,
piqua shawnee tribe , and
ani - yun - wiya nation .

law and government


state government

the foundational document for alabama's government is the alabama constitution , which was ratified in 1901 . at almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words , it is by some accounts the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the united states constitution .
there has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabama's constitution . critics argue that alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature , leaving practically no power in local hands . most counties do not have home rule . any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and , frequently , by state referendum . one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism .
alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches . the legislative branch is the alabama legislature , a bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives , with 105 members , and the alabama senate , with 35 members . the legislature is responsible for writing , debating , passing , or defeating state legislation . the republican party currently holds a majority in both houses of the legislature . the legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority ( most state legislatures require a two - thirds majority to override a veto ).
until 1964 , the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county , with one per county . it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901 ; as a result , urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented . it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses , either . in reynolds v . sims ( 1964 ), the us supreme court implemented the principle of " one man , one vote ", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses ( as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented .) further , the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population , as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems .
at that time , alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting , as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts . this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas . for instance , birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one - third of the state budget , but jefferson county received only 1 / 67th of state services in funding . through the legislative delegations , the alabama legislature kept control of county governments .
the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws . it is headed by the governor of alabama . other members of executive branch include the cabinet , the attorney general of alabama , the alabama secretary of state , the alabama state treasurer , and the state auditor of alabama . the current governor of the state is republican kay ivey . the office of lieutenant governor is currently vacant .
the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections . statewide officials , such as the governor , lieutenant governor , attorney general , and other constitutional officers , take office the following january .
the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the state's constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases . the state's highest court is the supreme court of alabama . alabama uses partisan elections to select judges . since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized . the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican lyn stuart . all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party . there are two intermediate appellate courts , the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals , and four trial courts : the circuit court ( trial court of general jurisdiction ), and the district , probate , and municipal courts .
some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions . alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country . in some years , it imposes more death sentences than does texas , a state which has a population five times larger . some of its cases have been highly controversial ; the supreme court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases . it was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence ; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole ( lwop ) that were voted unanimously by juries . this judicial authority was removed in april 2017 .

taxes

alabama levies a 2 , 4 , or 5 percent personal income tax , depending upon the amount earned and filing status . taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax , and can do so even if taking the standard deduction . taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the federal insurance contributions act tax ( social security and medicare tax ).
the state's general sales tax rate is 4 %. sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases . for example , the total sales tax rate in mobile is 10 % and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1 %, which means that a diner in mobile would pay an 11 % tax on a meal . , sales and excise taxes in alabama account for 51 % of all state and local revenue , compared with an average of about 36 % nationwide . alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods , and one of two states ( the other being neighboring mississippi ) which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low - income families . ( most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate .)
alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the united states . alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as 4,600 , which is barely one - quarter of the federal poverty line . alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the district of columbia with income taxes .
the corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5 %. the overall federal , state , and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least tax - burdened state in the country . property taxes are the lowest in the u.s . the current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes .
since alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending , it is subject to high variable budget structure . for example , in 2003 , alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as 670 million .

county and local governments

alabama has 67 counties . each county has its own elected legislative branch , usually called the county commission . it also has limited executive authority in the county . because of the constraints of the alabama constitution , which centralizes power in the state legislature , only seven counties ( jefferson , lee , mobile , madison , montgomery , shelby , and tuscaloosa ) in the state have limited home rule . instead , most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved , ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning .
the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties , as recommended by the 1973 alabama constitutional commission . legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county . united states supreme court decisions in baker v . carr ( 1964 ) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population , and redistricted after each census , in order to implement the principle of " one man , one vote ". before that , each county was represented by one state senator , leading to under - representation in the state senate for more urbanized , populous counties . the rural bias of the state legislature , which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house , affected politics well into the 20th century , failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas .
" the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution . alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times , and almost one - third of the amendments are local in nature , applying to only one county or city . a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation , taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance ."
alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state , meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol . the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state . twenty - five of the 67 counties are " dry counties " which ban the sale of alcohol , and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales .

politics

during reconstruction following the american civil war , alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope . in 1874 , the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans , in part by suppressing the black vote through violence , fraud and intimidation .
after 1890 , a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents , a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution . provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor whites . by 1941 more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised : 600,000 to 520,000 . the total effects were greater on the black community , as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law .
from 1901 through the 1960s , the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas . as counties were the basis of election districts , the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three - quarters of the century , until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation .
alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement , when whites bureaucratically , and at times violently , resisted protests for electoral and social reform . governor george wallace , the state's only four - term governor , was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation . only after passage of the federal civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage , among other civil rights . in many jurisdictions , they continued to be excluded from representation by at - large electoral systems , which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections . some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single - member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards .
in 2007 , the alabama legislature passed , and republican governor bob riley signed a resolution expressing " profound regret " over slavery and its lingering impact . in a symbolic ceremony , the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol , which housed congress of the confederate states of america .
in 2010 , republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years .
, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters , with 2,979,576 active , and the others inactive in the state .

elections


state elections

with the disfranchisement of blacks in 1901 , the state became part of the " solid south ", a system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state . for nearly 100 years , local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary , with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election . since the mid to late 20th century , however , there has been a realignment among the two major political parties , and white conservatives started shifting to the republican party . in alabama , majority - white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal , state and local office .
members of the nine seats on the supreme court of alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office . until 1994 , no republicans held any of the court seats . in that general election , the then - incumbent chief justice , ernest c . hornsby , refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to republican perry o . hooper , sr .. hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court . this ultimately led to a collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles . the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august 2011 with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench .
in the early 21st century , republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices . republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education . in 2010 , republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature , giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years . the last remaining statewide democrat , who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in 2012 .
only two republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction , when republicans generally represented reconstruction government , including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise . the two gop lt . governors were steve windom ( 1999 – 2003 ) and kay ivey ( 2011 – 2017 ).

local elections

many local offices ( county commissioners , boards of education , tax assessors , tax collectors , etc .) in the state are still held by democrats . many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats , resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary . similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority - republican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary , although there are exceptions .
alabama's 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan , at - large races , and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts . the current split is 35 democrats , 31 republicans , and one independent fayette . however , most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties . the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban / suburban and heavily populated counties . , the state of alabama has one female sheriff , in morgan county , alabama , and ten african - american sheriffs .

federal elections

the state's two u.s . senators are republican richard c . shelby and democrat doug jones . shelby was originally elected to the senate as a democrat in 1986 and re - elected in 1992 , but switched parties immediately following the november 1994 general election .
in the u.s . house of representatives , the state is represented by seven members , six of whom are republicans : ( bradley byrne , mike d . rogers , robert aderholt , morris j . brooks , martha roby , and gary palmer ) and one democrat : terri sewell who represents the black belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of birmingham , tuscaloosa and montgomery .

while alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades , it lags behind in achievement compared to other states . according to u.s . census data ( 2000 ), alabama's high school graduation rate — 75 %— is the fourth lowest in the u.s . ( after kentucky , louisiana and mississippi ). the largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees .
although unusual in the west , school corporal punishment is not uncommon in alabama , with 27,260 public school students paddled at least one time , according to government data for the 2011 – 2012 school year . the rate of school corporal punishment in alabama is surpassed only by mississippi and arkansas .

several u.s . highways also pass through the state , such as u.s . route 11 ( us - 11 ), us - 29 , us - 31 , us - 43 , us - 45 , us - 72 , us - 78 , us - 80 , us - 82 , us - 84 , us - 90 , us - 98 , us - 231 , us - 278 , us - 280 , us - 331 , us - 411 , and us - 431 .
there are four toll roads in the state : montgomery expressway in montgomery ; tuscaloosa bypass in tuscaloosa ; emerald mountain expressway in wetumpka ; and beach express in orange beach .

achilles
in greek mythology , achilles or achilleus ( ; , achilleus ) was a greek hero of the trojan war and the central character and the greatest warrior of homer's iliad . his mother was the immortal nereid thetis , and his father , the mortal peleus , was the king of the myrmidons .
achilles ' most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan hero hector outside the gates of troy . although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad , other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris , who shot him in the heel with an arrow . later legends ( beginning with a poem by statius in the 1st century ad ) state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel because , when his mother thetis dipped him in the river styx as an infant , she held him by one of his heels . alluding to these legends , the term " achilles ' heel " has come to mean a point of weakness , especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution . the achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends .

etymology

linear b tablets attest to the personal name achilleus in the forms a - ki - re - u and a - ki - re - we , the latter being the dative of the former . the name grew more popular , even becoming common soon after the seventh century bc and was also turned into the female form ἀχιλλεία ( achilleía ), attested in attica in the fourth century bc ( ig ii 1617 ) and , in the form achillia , on a stele in halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an " amazon ".
achilles ' name can be analyzed as a combination of () " distress , pain , sorrow , grief " and () " people , soldiers , nation ", resulting in a proto - form * akhí - lāu̯os " he who has the people distressed " or " he whose people have distress ". the grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the iliad ( and frequently by achilles himself ). achilles ' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of (" glory ", usually in war ). furthermore , laós has been construed by gregory nagy , following leonard palmer , to mean " a corps of soldiers ", a muster . with this derivation , the name obtains a double meaning in the poem : when the hero is functioning rightly , his men bring distress to the enemy , but when wrongly , his men get the grief of war . the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership .
another etymology relates the name to a proto - indo - european compound * h eḱ - pṓds " sharp foot " which first gave an illyrian * āk̂pediós , evolving through time into * ākhpdeós and then * akhiddeús . the shift from - dd - to - ll - is then ascribed to the passing of the name into greek via a pre - greek source . the first root part * h eḱ - " sharp , pointed " also gave greek ἀκή ( akḗ " point , silence , healing "), ἀκμή ( akmḗ " point , edge , zenith ") and ὀξύσ ( oxús " sharp , pointed , keen , quick , clever "), whereas ἄχοσ stems from the root * h egʰ - " to be upset , afraid ". the whole expression would be comparable to the latin acupedius " swift of foot ". compare also the latin word family of aciēs " sharp edge or point , battle line , battle , engagement ", acus " needle , pin , bodkin ", and acuō " to make pointed , sharpen , whet ; to exercise ; to arouse " ( whence acute ). some topical epitheta of achilles in the iliad point to this " swift - footedness ", namely ποδάρκησ δῖοσ ἀχιλλεὺσ ( podárkēs dĩos achilleús " swift - footed divine achilles ") or , even more frequently , πόδασ ὠκὺσ ἀχιλλεύσ ( pódas ōkús achilleús " quick - footed achilles ").
some researchers deem the name a loan word , possibly from a pre - greek language . achilles ' descent from the nereid thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as acheron and achelous have led to speculations about him being an old water divinity ( see below worship ). robert s . p . beekes has suggested a pre - greek origin of the name , based among other things on the coexistence of - λλ - and - λ - in epic language , which may account for a palatalized phoneme / ly / in the original language .

birth and early years

achilles was the son of the nereid thetis and of peleus , the king of the myrmidons . zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus , the fore - thinker , warned zeus of a prophecy ( originally uttered by themis , goddess of divine law ) that thetis would bear a son greater than his father . for this reason , the two gods withdrew their pursuit , and had her wed peleus .
there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events : in the argonautica ( 4.760 ) zeus ' sister and wife hera alludes to thetis ' chaste resistance to the advances of zeus , pointing out that thetis was so loyal to hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods . thetis , although a daughter of the sea - god nereus , was also brought up by hera , further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus . zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal .
according to the achilleid , written by statius in the 1st century ad , and to non - surviving previous sources , when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx . however , he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him : his left heel ( see achilles ' heel , achilles ' tendon ). it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier . in another version of this story , thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body . she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage .
however , none of the sources before statius make any reference to this general invulnerability . to the contrary , in the iliad homer mentions achilles being wounded : in book 21 the paeonian hero asteropaeus , son of pelagon , challenged achilles by the river scamander . he cast two spears at once , one grazed achilles ' elbow , " drawing a spurt of blood ".
also , in the fragmentary poems of the epic cycle in which one can find description of the hero's death ( i.e . the cypria , the little iliad by lesches of pyrrha , the aithiopis and iliou persis by arctinus of miletus ), there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel ; in the later vase paintings presenting the death of achilles , the arrow ( or in many cases , arrows ) hit his body . peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur , on mount pelion , to be reared . thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young , or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity . achilles chose the former , and decided to take part in the trojan war . according to homer , achilles grew up in phthia together with his companion patroclus .
according to photius , the sixth book of the new history by ptolemy hephaestion reported that thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by peleus ; but when she had achilles , peleus noticed , tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot , and confided him to the centaur chiron . later chiron exhumed the body of the damysus , who was the fastest of all the giants , removed the ankle , and incorporated it into achilles ' burnt foot .

hidden on skyros

some post - homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war , thetis ( or , in some versions , peleus ) hid the young man at the court of lycomedes , king of skyros . there , achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among lycomedes ' daughters , perhaps under the name " pyrrha " ( the red - haired girl ). with lycomedes ' daughter deidamia , whom in the account of statius he rapes , achilles there fathers a son , neoptolemus ( also called pyrrhus , after his father's possible alias ). according to this story , odysseus learns from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles ' aid . odysseus goes to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods . when achilles instantly takes up the spear , odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the greek campaign . in another version of the story , odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes ' women ; while the women flee in panic , achilles prepares to defend the court , thus giving his identity away .

in the trojan war

according to the iliad , achilles arrived at troy with 50 ships , each carrying 50 myrmidons . he appointed five leaders ( each leader commanding 500 myrmidons ): menesthius , eudorus , peisander , phoenix and alcimedon .

telephus

when the greeks left for the trojan war , they accidentally stopped in mysia , ruled by king telephus . in the resulting battle , achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal ; telephus consulted an oracle , who stated that " he that wounded shall heal ". guided by the oracle , he arrived at argos , where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy .
according to other reports in euripides ' lost play about telephus , he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound . achilles refused , claiming to have no medical knowledge . alternatively , telephus held orestes for ransom , the ransom being achilles ' aid in healing the wound . odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound ; therefore , the spear must be able to heal it . pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed .

troilus

according to the cypria ( the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles ' wrath ), when the achaeans desired to return home , they were restrained by achilles , who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas , sacked neighbouring cities ( like pedasus and lyrnessus , where the greeks capture the queen briseis ) and killed tenes , a son of apollo , as well as priam's son troilus in the sanctuary of apollo thymbraios . however , the romance between troilus and chryseis described in geoffrey chaucer's troilus and criseyde and in william shakespeare's troilus and cressida is a medieval invention .
in dares phrygius ' account of the destruction of troy , the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe , as well as in older accounts , troilus was a young trojan prince , the youngest of king priam's and hecuba's five legitimate sons ( or according other sources , another son of apollo ). despite his youth , he was one of the main trojan war leaders , a " horse fighter " or " chariot fighter " according to homer . prophecies linked troilus ' fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him . yet achilles , struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena , and overcome with lust , directed his sexual attentions on the youth – who , refusing to yield , instead found himself decapitated upon an altar - omphalos of apollo thymbraios . later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over - ardent lovers ' embrace . in this version of the myth , achilles ' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege . ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents . had troilus lived to adulthood , the first vatican mythographer claimed , troy would have been invincible .

in the iliad

homer's iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles ' deeds in the trojan war . achilles ' wrath ( μῆνισ ἀχιλλέωσ , mênis achilléōs ) is the central theme of the poem . the first two lines of the iliad read :
the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade - long war , and does not narrate achilles ' death . it begins with achilles ' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by agamemnon , the commander of the achaean forces . agamemnon has taken a woman named chryseis as his slave . her father chryses , a priest of apollo , begs agamemnon to return her to him . agamemnon refuses , and apollo sends a plague amongst the greeks . the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him . achilles does so , and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father . agamemnon consents , but then commands that achilles ' battle prize briseis , the daughter of briseus , be brought to him to replace chryseis . angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away ( and , as he says later , because he loves briseis ), with the urging of his mother thetis , achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces . at the same time , burning with rage over agamemnon's theft , achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war , so that he may regain his honour .
as the battle turns against the greeks , thanks to the influence of zeus , nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles , and urges the king to appease the warrior . agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains , ajax and phoenix , to achilles with the offer of the return of briseis and other gifts . achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do .
the trojans , led by hector , subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships . with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction , patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle , wearing achilles ' armour , though achilles remains at his camp . patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches , but is killed by hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of troy .
after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus , the son of nestor , achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death . his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles . she persuades hephaestus to make new armour for him , in place of the armour that patroclus had been wearing , which was taken by hector . the new armour includes the shield of achilles , described in great detail in the poem .
enraged over the death of patroclus , achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field , killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector . achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander , who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed . the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus . zeus himself takes note of achilles ' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction , seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself . finally , achilles finds his prey . achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena , in the form of hector's favorite and dearest brother , deiphobus , persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face . after hector realizes the trick , he knows the battle is inevitable . wanting to go down fighting , he charges at achilles with his only weapon , his sword , but misses . accepting his fate , hector begs achilles , not to spare his life , but to treat his body with respect after killing him . achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him , declaring that " my rage , my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me ". achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot . after having a dream where patroclus begs achilles to hold his funeral , achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honour .
during the cremation of patroclus , achilles is referred to as the star that outshines all stars in the autumn sky , orion's dog ( sirius ), and a sign of evil . subsequently he is compared to hesper ( hesperus ), the evening / western star ( venus ), while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until phosphorus , the morning / eastern star ( also venus ) has set ( descended ).
with the assistance of the god hermes , hector's father , priam , goes to achilles ' tent to plead with achilles for the return of hector's body so that he can be buried . achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral . the poem ends with a description of hector's funeral , with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come .

later epic accounts : fighting penthesilea and memnon

the aethiopis ( 7th century bc ) and a work named posthomerica , composed by quintus of smyrna in the fourth century ad , relate further events from the trojan war . when penthesilea , queen of the amazons and daughter of ares , arrives in troy , priam hopes that she will defeat achilles . after his temporary truce with priam , achilles fights and kills the warrior queen , only to grieve over her death later . at first , he was so distracted by her beauty , he did not fight as intensely as usual . once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life , he refocused and killed her .
following the death of patroclus , nestor's son antilochus becomes achilles ' closest companion . when memnon , son of the dawn goddess eos and king of ethiopia , slays antilochus , achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield , killing memnon . consequently , eos will not let the sun rise , until zeus persuades her . the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus , except that memnon ( unlike hector ) was also the son of a goddess .
many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliads description of the death of patroclus and achilles ' reaction to it . the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis , which was composed after the iliad , possibly in the 7th century bc . the aethiopis is now lost , except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors .

achilles and patroclus

the exact nature of achilles ' relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times . in the iliad , it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship . homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus were lovers . despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers , this theory was expressed by some later authors . commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures . in 5th - century bc athens , the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia . in plato's symposium , the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple ; phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover . but ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual , and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women .

death

the death of achilles , as predicted by hector with his dying breath , was brought about by paris with an arrow ( to the heel according to statius ). in some versions , the god apollo guided paris ' arrow . some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow . all of these versions deny paris any sort of valour , owing to the common conception that paris was a coward and not the man his brother hector was , and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield . his bones were mingled with those of patroclus , and funeral games were held . he was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube .
another version of achilles ' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses , polyxena . achilles asks priam for polyxena's hand in marriage . priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior . but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles , paris , who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister , hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow , killing him .
in the odyssey , agamemnon informs achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his mound at the hellespont while they are receiving the dead suitors in hades . he claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean . achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patroclus . paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles .
in book 11 of homer's odyssey , odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades . one of these is achilles , who when greeted as " blessed in life , blessed in death ", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead . but achilles then asks odysseus of his son's exploits in the trojan war , and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus ' heroic actions , achilles is filled with satisfaction . this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life .
according to some accounts , he had married medea in life , so that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades – as hera promised thetis in apollonius ' argonautica ( 3rd century bc ).

fate of achilles ' armour

achilles ' armour was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ( ajax the greater ). they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners , who after considering both men , decided odysseus was more deserving of the armour . furious , ajax cursed odysseus , which earned him the ire of athena . athena temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep , thinking them his comrades . after a while , when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep , ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide . odysseus eventually gave the armour to neoptolemus , the son of achilles .
a relic claimed to be achilles ' bronze - headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis , lycia , a port on the pamphylian gulf . the city was visited in 333 bc by alexander the great , who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him , but his court biographers do not mention the spear . however , it was shown in the time of pausanias in the 2nd century ad .

achilles , ajax and a game of petteia

numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions . at some point in the war , achilles and ajax were playing a board game ( petteia ). they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle . the trojans attacked and reached the heroes , who were saved only by an intervention of athena .

worship and heroic cult

the tomb of achilles , extant throughout antiquity in troad , was venerated by thessalians , but also by persian expeditionary forces , as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla . achilles ' cult was also to be found at other places , e . g . on the island of astypalaea in the sporades , in sparta which had a sanctuary , in elis and in achilles ' homeland thessaly , as well as in the magna graecia cities of tarentum , locri and croton , accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero .
the cult of achilles is illustrated in the 500 bc polyxena sarcophagus , where the sacrifice of polixena near the tumulus of achilles is depicted . strabo ( 13.1.32 ) also suggested that such a cult of achilles existed in troad :
the spread and intensity of the hero's veneration among the greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus , today's black sea , appears to have been remarkable . an archaic cult is attested for the milesian colony of olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea , today identified with snake island ( ukrainian зміїний , zmiinyi , near kiliya , ukraine ). early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea ( graffiti and inscribed clay disks , these possibly being votive offerings , from olbia , the area of berezan island and the tauric chersonese ) attest the existence of a heroic cult of achilles from the sixth century bc onwards . the cult was still thriving in the third century ad , when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an achilles pontárchēs ( ποντάρχησ , roughly " lord of the sea ," or " of the pontus euxinus "), who was invoked as a protector of the city of olbia , venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates , hermes agoraeus , or poseidon .
pliny the elder ( 23 – 79 ad ) in his natural history mentions a " port of the achæi " and an " island of achilles ", famous for the tomb of that " man " ( portus achaeorum , insula achillis , tumulo eius viri clara ), situated somewhat nearby olbia and the dnieper - bug estuary ; furthermore , at 125 roman miles from this island , he places a peninsula " which stretches forth in the shape of a sword " obliquely , called dromos achilleos ( ἀχιλλέωσ δρόμοσ , achilléōs drómos " the race - course of achilles ") and considered the place of the hero's exercise or of games instituted by him . this last feature of pliny's account is considered to be the iconic spit , called today tendra ( or kosa tendra and kosa djarilgatch ), situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay , but which is hardly 125 roman miles ( c . 185 km ) away from the dnieper - bug estuary , as pliny states . ( to the " race - course " he gives a length of 80 miles , c . 120 km , whereas the spit measures c . 70 km today .)
in the following chapter of his book , pliny refers to the same island as achillea and introduces two further names for it : leuce or macaron ( from greek [ νῆσοσ ] μακαρῶν " island of the blest "). the " present day " measures , he gives at this point , seem to account for an identification of achillea or leuce with today's snake island . pliny's contemporary pomponius mela ( c . 43 ad ) tells that achilles was buried on an island named achillea , situated between the borysthenes and the ister , adding to the geographical confusion . ruins of a square temple , measuring 30 meters to a side , possibly that dedicated to achilles , were discovered by captain kritzikly in 1823 on snake island . a second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple . a fifth century bc black - glazed lekythos inscription , found on the island in 1840 , reads : " glaukos , son of poseidon , dedicated me to achilles , lord of leuke ." in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc , a statue is dedicated to achilles , lord of leuke , by a citizen of olbia , while in a further dedication , the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island's cult , again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra - regional hero veneration .
the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic aethiopis according to which , after his untimely death , thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical λεύκη νῆσοσ ( leúkē nêsos " white island "). already in the fifth century bc , pindar had mentioned a cult of achilles on a " bright island " ( φαεννά νᾶσοσ , phaenná nâsos ) of the black sea , while in another of his works , pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on a geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmus . well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles ( μακαρῶν νῆσοι , makárôn nêsoi ) or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world , which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it . guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by alcaeus , speaking of " achilles lord of scythia " and the opposition of north and south , as evoked by achilles ' fight against the aethiopian prince memnon , who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death .
the periplus of the euxine sea ( c . 130 ad ) gives the following details :
the greek geographer dionysius periegetes , who lived probably during the first century ad , wrote that the island was called leuce " because the wild animals which live there are white . it is said that there , in leuce island , reside the souls of achilles and other heroes , and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island ; this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues , because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour ". similarly , others relate the island's name to its white cliffs , snakes or birds dwelling there . pausanias has been told that the island is " covered with forests and full of animals , some wild , some tame . in this island there is also achilles ' temple and his statue ". leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing . pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound . ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters ( aquae ) on the island .
a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles . herodotus , pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of a town achílleion ( ἀχίλλειον ), built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc , close to the hero's presumed burial mound in the troad . later attestations point to an achílleion in messenia ( according to stephanus byzantinus ) and an achílleios ( ἀχίλλειοσ ) in laconia . nicolae densuşianu recognized a connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta , called chilia ( presumably from an older achileii ), though his conclusion , that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea , evokes modern rather than archaic sea - law .
the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son , neoptolemus . alexander the great , son of the epirote princess olympias , could therefore also claim this descent , and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor . he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy . in ad 216 the roman emperor caracalla , while on his way to war against parthia , emulated alexander by holding games around achilles ' tumulus .

reception during antiquity


in greek tragedy

the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles , given the title achilleis by modern scholars . the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war , including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel . extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play . the first part of the achilleis trilogy , the myrmidons , focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus , who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon ; only a few lines survive today . in plato's symposium , phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved ; phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles , being the younger and more beautiful of the two , was the beloved , who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him .
the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles , a play with achilles as the main character . only a few fragments survive .
towards the end of the 5th century bc , a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama ; euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in hecuba , electra , and iphigenia in aulis .

in greek philosophy

the philosopher zeno of elea centered one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between " swift - footed " achilles and a tortoise , by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start , and therefore that motion and change were impossible . as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school , zeno believed time and motion to be illusions .

achilles in roman and medieval literature

the romans , who traditionally traced their lineage to troy , took a highly negative view of achilles . virgil refers to achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men , while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children . other writers , such as catullus , propertius , and ovid , represent a second strand of disparagement , with an emphasis on achilles ' erotic career . this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in benoît de sainte - maure's roman de troie and guido delle colonne's historia destructionis troiae , which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the 17th century .
achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler leo the deacon , not as hellene , but as scythian , while according to the byzantine author john malalas , his army was made up of a tribe previously known as myrmidons and later as bulgars .

abraham lincoln
abraham lincoln ( february 12 , 1809 – april 15 , 1865 ) was an american lawyer and politician who served as the 16th president of the united states from 1861 until his assassination in april 1865 . lincoln led the nation through the civil war , its bloodiest war and its greatest moral , constitutional , and political crisis . in doing so , he preserved the union , abolished slavery , strengthened the federal government , and modernized the economy .
born in kentucky , lincoln grew up on the western frontier in a poor family . self - educated , he became a lawyer in illinois . as a whig party leader , he served eight years in the state legislature and two in congress , then resumed his law practice . angered by the success of democrats in opening the western prairie lands to slavery , he reentered politics in 1854 . he was a leader in building in the west the new republican party from whigs and anti - slavery democrats . he gained national attention in 1858 debating a top national democratic leader stephen a . douglas . although he lost that race , he became the western candidate for the 1860 presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state . he swept the north and was elected president in 1860 . southern pro - slavery elements took his win as proof that the north was rejecting the constitutional rights of southern states to promote slavery . they began the process of seceding from the union and forming a new country . but nationalism was a powerful force in the north , which refused to tolerate secession . when the new confederate states of america fired on fort sumter , one of the few u.s . forts left in the south , lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the union . as the leader of the moderate faction of the republican party , lincoln confronted radical republicans , who demanded harsher treatment of the south ; war democrats , who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp ; anti - war democrats ( called copperheads ), who despised him ; and irreconcilable secessionists , who plotted his assassination .
lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other , by carefully distributed political patronage and by appealing to the american people with his powers of oratory . his gettysburg address became an iconic endorsement of nationalism , republicanism , equal rights , liberty , and democracy . he suspended habeas corpus , and he averted british intervention by defusing the trent affair . lincoln closely supervised the war effort , especially the selection of generals , including his most successful general , ulysses s . grant . he made major decisions on union war strategy , including a naval blockade that shut down the south's trade . as the war progressed , his complex moves toward ending slavery included the emancipation proclamation of 1863 ; lincoln used the u.s . army to protect escaped slaves , encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery , and pushed through congress the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution , which permanently outlawed slavery .
an astute politician , knowledgeable concerning factional feuds in each state , lincoln reached out to the war democrats and managed his own re - election campaign in the 1864 presidential election . anticipating the war's conclusion , lincoln pushed a moderate view of reconstruction , seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness . a few days after victory was complete he was assassinated , and ever since lincoln has been remembered as the martyr hero of the reunited nation . lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest u.s . presidents .

family and childhood


early life

abraham lincoln was born on february 12 , 1809 , as the second child of thomas and nancy hanks lincoln , in a one - room log cabin on the sinking spring farm near hodgenville , kentucky . he was a descendant of samuel lincoln , an englishman who migrated from hingham , norfolk , to its namesake of hingham , massachusetts , in 1638 . samuel's grandson and great - grandson began the family's western migration , which passed through new jersey , pennsylvania , and virginia . lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake , captain abraham lincoln , moved the family from virginia to jefferson county , kentucky , in the 1780s . captain lincoln was killed in an indian raid in 1786 . his children , including eight - year - old thomas , the future president's father , witnessed the attack . after his father's murder , thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier , working at odd jobs in kentucky and in tennessee , before settling with members of his family in hardin county , kentucky , in the early 1800s .
lincoln's mother , nancy , is widely assumed to have been the daughter of lucy hanks , although no record of nancy hanks ' birth has ever been found . according to william ensign lincoln's book the ancestry of abraham lincoln , nancy was the daughter of joseph hanks ; however , the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock . still another researcher , adin baber , claims that nancy hanks was the daughter of abraham hanks and sarah harper of virginia .
thomas lincoln and nancy hanks were married on june 12 , 1806 , in washington county , and moved to elizabethtown , kentucky , following their marriage . they became the parents of three children : sarah , born on february 10 , 1807 ; abraham , on february 12 , 1809 ; and another son , thomas , who died in infancy .
thomas lincoln bought or leased several farms in kentucky , including the sinking spring farm , where abraham was born ; however , a land title dispute soon forced the lincolns to move . in 1811 , the family moved north , to knob creek farm , where thomas acquired title to of land . in 1815 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm .
of the that thomas held in kentucky , he lost all but of his land in court disputes over property titles . frustrated over the lack of security provided by the kentucky title survey system in the courts , thomas sold the remaining land he held in kentucky in 1814 , and began planning a move to indiana , where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure .
in 1816 , the family moved north across the ohio river to indiana , a free , non - slaveholding territory , where they settled in an " unbroken forest " in hurricane township , perry county . ( their land in southern indiana became part of spencer county , indiana , when the county was established in 1818 .) the farm is preserved as part of the lincoln boyhood national memorial . in 1860 , lincoln noted that the family's move to indiana was " partly on account of slavery "; but mainly due to land title difficulties in kentucky .
during the family's years in kentucky and indiana , thomas lincoln worked as a farmer , cabinetmaker , and carpenter . he owned farms , several town lots and livestock , paid taxes , sat on juries , appraised estates , served on country slave patrols , and guarded prisoners . thomas and nancy lincoln were also members of a separate baptists church , which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol , dancing , and slavery .
within a year of the family's arrival in indiana , thomas claimed title to of indiana land . despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained clear title to of land in what became known as the little pigeon creek community in spencer county . prior to the family's move to illinois in 1830 , thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property .
several significant family events took place during lincoln's youth in indiana . on october 5 , 1818 , nancy lincoln died of milk sickness , leaving 11 - year - old sarah in charge of a household that included her father , 9 - year - old abraham , and dennis hanks , nancy's 19 - year - old orphaned cousin .
on december 2 , 1819 , lincoln's father married sarah " sally " bush johnston , a widow from elizabethtown , kentucky , with three children of her own . abraham became very close to his stepmother , whom he referred to as " mother ". those who knew lincoln as a teenager later recalled him being very distraught over his sister sarah's death on january 20 , 1828 , while giving birth to a stillborn son .
as a youth , lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life . some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his " reading , scribbling , writing , ciphering , writing poetry , etc .", and must have done it to avoid manual labor . his stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy " physical labor ", but loved to read .
lincoln was largely self - educated . his formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent , the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year ; however , he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning . family , neighbors , and schoolmates of lincoln's youth recalled that he read and reread the king james bible , aesop's fables , john bunyan's the pilgrim's progress , daniel defoe's robinson crusoe , mason locke weems's the life of washington , and the autobiography of benjamin franklin , among others .
as he grew into his teens , lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household . he also complied with the customary obligation of a son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of 21 . abraham became adept at using an axe . tall for his age , lincoln was also strong and athletic . he attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as " the clary's grove boys ".
in early march 1830 , partly out of fear of a milk sickness outbreak along the ohio river , several members of the extended lincoln family moved west to illinois , a non - slaveholding state , and settled in macon county , west of decatur . historians disagree on who initiated the move ; thomas lincoln had no obvious reason to leave indiana , and one possibility is that other members of the family , including dennis hanks , might not have attained the stability and steady income that thomas lincoln had .
after the family relocated to illinois , abraham became increasingly distant from his father , in part because of his father's lack of education , but occasionally lent him money . in 1831 , as thomas and other members of the family prepared to move to a new homestead in coles county , illinois , abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own . traveling down the sangamon river , he ended up in the village of new salem in sangamon county . later that spring , denton offutt , a new salem merchant , hired lincoln and some friends to take goods by flatboat from new salem to new orleans via the sangamon , illinois , and mississippi rivers . after arriving in new orleans — and witnessing slavery firsthand — lincoln returned to new salem , where he remained for the next six years .

marriage and children

according to some sources , lincoln's first romantic interest was ann rutledge , whom he met when he first moved to new salem ; these sources indicate that by 1835 , they were in a relationship but not formally engaged . she died at the age of 22 on august 25 , 1835 , most likely of typhoid fever . in the early 1830s , he met mary owens from kentucky when she was visiting her sister .
late in 1836 , lincoln agreed to a match with mary if she returned to new salem . mary did return in november 1836 , and lincoln courted her for a time ; however , they both had second thoughts about their relationship . on august 16 , 1837 , lincoln wrote mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship . she never replied and the courtship ended .
in 1840 , lincoln became engaged to mary todd , who was from a wealthy slave - holding family in lexington , kentucky . they met in springfield , illinois in december 1839 and were engaged the following december . a wedding set for january 1 , 1841 , was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at lincoln's initiative . they later met again at a party and married on november 4 , 1842 , in the springfield mansion of mary's married sister . while preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again , lincoln , when asked where he was going , replied , " to hell , i suppose ." in 1844 , the couple bought a house in springfield near lincoln's law office . mary todd lincoln kept house , often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl .
he was an affectionate , though often absent , husband and father of four children . robert todd lincoln was born in 1843 and edward baker lincoln ( eddie ) in 1846 . edward died on february 1 , 1850 , in springfield , probably of tuberculosis . " willie " lincoln was born on december 21 , 1850 , and died of a fever on february 20 , 1862 . the lincolns ' fourth son , thomas " tad " lincoln , was born on april 4 , 1853 , and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on july 16 , 1871 . robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children . the lincolns ' last descendant , great - grandson robert todd lincoln beckwith , died in 1985 . lincoln " was remarkably fond of children ", and the lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own .
the deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents . abraham lincoln suffered from " melancholy ", a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression . later in life , mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons , and robert lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875 .

lincoln's father - in - law and others of the todd family were either slave owners or slave traders . lincoln was close to the todds , and he and his family occasionally visited the todd estate in lexington .
during his term as president of the united states , mary was known to cook for lincoln often . since she was raised by a wealthy family , her cooking abilities were simple , but satisfied lincoln's tastes , which included , particularly , imported oysters .

early career and militia service

in 1832 , at age 23 , lincoln and a partner ( denton offutt ) bought a small general store on credit in new salem , illinois . although the economy was booming in the region , the business struggled and lincoln eventually sold his share . that march he began his political career with his first campaign for the illinois general assembly . he had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in new salem , though he lacked an education , powerful friends , and money , which may be why he lost . he advocated navigational improvements on the sangamon river .
before the election , lincoln served as a captain in the illinois militia during the black hawk war . following his return , lincoln continued his campaign for the august 6 election for the illinois general assembly . at , he was tall and " strong enough to intimidate any rival ". at his first speech , when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked , lincoln grabbed the assailant by his " neck and the seat of his trousers " and threw him . lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates ( the top four were elected ), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the new salem precinct .
lincoln served as new salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor , all the while reading voraciously . he then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading blackstone's commentaries on the laws of england and other law books . of his learning method , lincoln stated : " i studied with nobody ". his second campaign in 1834 was successful . he won election to the state legislature ; though he ran as a whig , many democrats favored him over a more powerful whig opponent .
admitted to the illinois bar in 1836 , he moved to springfield , illinois , and began to practice law under john t . stuart , mary todd's cousin . lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross - examinations and closing arguments . he partnered with stephen t . logan from 1841 until 1844 . then lincoln began his practice with william herndon , whom lincoln thought " a studious young man ".
successful on his second run for office , lincoln served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a whig representative from sangamon county . he supported the construction of the illinois and michigan canal , which he remained involved with later as a canal commissioner . in the 1835 – 36 legislative session , he voted to expand suffrage to white males , whether landowners or not . he was known for his " free soil " stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism . he first articulated this in 1837 , saying , "[ the ] institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy , but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils ." his stance closely followed henry clay in supporting the american colonization society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in liberia in africa .

u.s . house of representatives , 1847 – 49

from the early 1830s , lincoln was a steadfast whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be " an old line whig , a disciple of henry clay ". the party , including lincoln , favored economic modernization in banking , protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads , and espoused urbanization as well .
lincoln ran for the whig nomination for illinois's 7th district of the u.s . house of representatives in 1843 , but was defeated by john j . hardin . however , lincoln won support for the principle of rotation , whereby hardin would retire after only one term to allow for the nomination of another candidate . lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846 . lincoln was indeed elected to the house of representatives in 1846 , where he served one two - year term . he was the only whig in the illinois delegation , but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line . lincoln , in collaboration with abolitionist congressman joshua r . giddings , wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners , enforcement to capture fugitive slaves , and a popular vote on the matter . he abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient whig supporters .

committee assignments

committee on post office and post roads
committee on expenditures in the war department
on foreign and military policy , lincoln spoke out against the mexican – american war , which he attributed to president polk's desire for " military glory — that attractive rainbow , that rises in showers of blood ". lincoln also supported the wilmot proviso , which , if it had been adopted , would have banned slavery in any u.s . territory won from mexico .
lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions . the war had begun with a mexican slaughter of american soldiers in territory disputed by mexico and the u.s . polk insisted that mexican soldiers had " invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow - citizens on our own soil ". lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil .
congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it , the national papers ignored it , and it resulted in a loss of political support for lincoln in his district . one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him " spotty lincoln ". lincoln later regretted some of his statements , especially his attack on the presidential war - making powers .
realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency , lincoln , who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the house , supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election . taylor won and lincoln hoped to be appointed commissioner of the general land office , but that lucrative patronage job went to an illinois rival , justin butterfield , considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer , but in lincoln's view , an " old fossil ". the administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the oregon territory . this distant territory was a democratic stronghold , and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in illinois , so he declined and resumed his law practice .

prairie lawyer

lincoln returned to practicing law in springfield , handling " every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer ". twice a year for 16 years , 10 weeks at a time , he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session . lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion , particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges . as a riverboat man , lincoln initially favored those interests , but ultimately represented whoever hired him . in fact , he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge . in 1849 , he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water . the idea was never commercialized , but lincoln is the only president to hold a patent .
in 1851 , he represented the alton & sangamon railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders , james a . barret , who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route . lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of barret's pledge ; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer , superior , and less expensive route , and the corporation retained the right to demand barret's payment . the decision by the illinois supreme court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation . lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in 175 cases , in 51 as sole counsel , of which 31 were decided in his favor . from 1853 to 1860 , another of lincoln's largest clients was the illinois central railroad . lincoln's reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname " honest abe ".
lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended william " duff " armstrong , who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker . the case is famous for lincoln's use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness . after an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight , lincoln produced a farmers ' almanac showing the moon was at a low angle , drastically reducing visibility . based on this evidence , armstrong was acquitted .
lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom ; but in an 1859 case , where he defended a cousin , peachy harrison , who was accused of stabbing another to death , lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client . instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as was expected , the judge , a democrat , reversed his ruling , allowing the evidence and acquitting harrison .

republican politics 1854 – 60


emergence as republican leader

the debate over the status of slavery in the territories exacerbated sectional tensions between the slave - holding south and the north , and the compromise of 1850 failed to defuse the issue . in the early 1850s , lincoln supported efforts for sectional mediation , and his 1852 eulogy for henry clay focused on the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to " both extremes " on the slavery issue . as the 1850s progressed , the debate over slavery in the nebraska territory and kansas territory became particularly acrimonious , and senator stephen a . douglas of illinois proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise measure ; the proposal would take the issue of slavery out of the hands of congress by allowing the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery themselves . the proposal alarmed many northerners , who hoped to stop the spread of slavery into the territories . despite this northern opposition , douglas's kansas – nebraska act narrowly passed congress in may 1854 .
for months after its passage , lincoln did not publicly comment on the kansas – nebraska act , but he came to strongly oppose it . on october 16 , 1854 , in his " peoria speech ", lincoln declared his opposition to slavery , which he repeated en route to the presidency . speaking in his kentucky accent , with a very powerful voice , he said the kansas act had a " declared indifference , but as i must think , a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery . i cannot but hate it . i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself . i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ..." lincoln's attacks on the kansas – nebraska act marked his return to political life .
nationally , the whigs were irreparably split by the kansas – nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue . reflecting the demise of his party , lincoln would write in 1855 , " i think i am a whig , but others say there are no whigs , and that i am an abolitionist [...] i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery ." drawing on the antislavery portion of the whig party , and combining free soil , liberty , and antislavery democratic party members , the new republican party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery . lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party , fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists . lincoln also still hoped to rejuvenate the ailing whig party , though he bemoaned his party's growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement .
in the 1854 elections , lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat . in the aftermath of the elections , which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the kansas – nebraska act , lincoln instead sought election to the united states senate . at that time , senators were elected by the state legislature . after leading in the first six rounds of voting , but unable to obtain a majority , lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull . trumbull was an antislavery democrat , and had received few votes in the earlier ballots ; his supporters , also antislavery democrats , had vowed not to support any whig . lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbull's antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate , joel aldrich matteson .
in part due to the ongoing violent political confrontations in the kansas , opposition to the kansas – nebraska act remained strong in illinois and throughout the north . as the 1856 elections approached , lincoln abandoned the defunct whig party in favor of the republicans . he attended the may 1856 bloomington convention , which formally established the illinois republican party . the convention platform asserted that congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of kansas as a free state . lincoln gave the final speech of the convention , in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the union . at the june 1856 republican national convention , lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot , though the party nominated a ticket of john c . frémont and william dayton . lincoln strongly supported the republican ticket , campaigning for the party throughout illinois . the democrats nominated former ambassador james buchanan , who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over slavery in the territories , while the know nothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore . in the 1856 elections , buchanan defeated both his challengers , but frémont won several northern states and republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois . though lincoln did not himself win office , his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading republican in illinois .
a portrait of dred scott . lincoln denounced the supreme court decision in dred scott v . sandford as part of a conspiracy to extend slavery .
eric foner ( 2010 ) contrasts the abolitionists and anti - slavery radical republicans of the northeast who saw slavery as a sin , with the conservative republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress . foner argues that lincoln was a moderate in the middle , opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the founding fathers , especially the equality of all men and democratic self - government as expressed in the declaration of independence .
in march 1857 , the supreme court issued its decision in dred scott v . sandford . the opinion by chief justice roger b . taney held that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution . while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories , the decision sparked further outrage in the north . lincoln denounced the decision , alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power . lincoln argued , " the authors of the declaration of independence never intended ' to say all were equal in color , size , intellect , moral developments , or social capacity ', but they ' did consider all men created equal — equal in certain inalienable rights , among which are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness '."

lincoln – douglas debates and cooper union speech

douglas was up for re - election in 1858 , and lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful illinois democrat . with the former democrat trumbull now serving as a republican senator , many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in 1858 , and lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor in the party . some eastern republicans favored the reelection of douglas for the senate in 1858 , since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution , which would have admitted kansas as a slave state . but many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference . for the first time , illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate , and lincoln won the party's senate nomination with little opposition .
accepting the nomination , lincoln delivered his house divided speech , drawing on mark 3 : 25 , " a house divided against itself cannot stand . i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free . i do not expect the union to be dissolved — i do not expect the house to fall — but i do expect it will cease to be divided . it will become all one thing , or all the other ." the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate , and rallied republicans across the north . the stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the illinois legislature which would , in turn , select lincoln or douglas as its u.s . senator . on being informed of lincoln's nomination , douglas stated , "[ lincoln ] is the strong man of the party ... and if i beat him , my victory will be hardly won ."
the senate campaign featured the seven lincoln – douglas debates of 1858 , the most famous political debates in american history . the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically . lincoln warned that " the slave power " was threatening the values of republicanism , and accused douglas of distorting the values of the founding fathers that all men are created equal , while douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine , that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not , and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists . the debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands . lincoln stated douglas ' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states . douglas said that lincoln was defying the authority of the u.s . supreme court and the dred scott decision .
though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes , the democrats won more seats , and the legislature re - elected douglas to the senate . despite the bitterness of the defeat for lincoln , his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation . in may 1859 , lincoln purchased the illinois staats - anzeiger , a german - language newspaper which was consistently supportive ; most of the state's 130,000 german americans voted democratic but there was republican support that a german - language paper could mobilize . in the aftermath of the 1858 election , newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate in 1860 , with william h . seward , salmon p . chase , edward bates , and simon cameron looming as rivals for the nomination . while lincoln was popular in the midwest , he lacked support in the northeast , and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency . in january 1860 , lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered , and in the following months several local papers endorsed lincoln for president .
on february 27 , 1860 , new york party leaders invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union to a group of powerful republicans . lincoln argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery . lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the republicans required opposition to slavery , and rejected any " groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong ". despite his inelegant appearance — many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly — lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the republican presidential nomination . journalist noah brooks reported , " no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience ."
historian donald described the speech as a " superb political move for an unannounced candidate , to appear in one rival's ( seward ) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's ( chase ) loyalists , while not mentioning either by name during its delivery ". in response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions , lincoln said , " the taste is in my mouth a little ."

1860 presidential nomination and campaign

on may 9 – 10 , 1860 , the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur . lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by david davis , norman judd , leonard swett , and jesse dubois , and lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency . exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father ( clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax ), lincoln's supporters adopted the label of " the rail candidate ". in 1860 lincoln described himself : " i am in height , six feet , four inches , nearly ; lean in flesh , weighing , on an average , one hundred and eighty pounds ; dark complexion , with coarse black hair , and gray eyes ."
on may 18 , at the republican national convention in chicago , lincoln became the republican candidate on the third ballot , beating candidates such as seward and chase . a former democrat , hannibal hamlin of maine , was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket . lincoln's success depended on his campaign team , his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue , and his strong support for whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff .
on the third ballot pennsylvania put him over the top . pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs . lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others , while following lincoln's strong dictate to " make no contracts that bind me ".
most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party , as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government with the dred scott decision and the presidency of james buchanan . throughout the 1850s , lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war , and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession . meanwhile , douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats . delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the democratic convention , disagreeing with douglas ' position on popular sovereignty , and ultimately selected incumbent vice president john c . breckinridge as their candidate . a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee . lincoln and douglas would compete for votes in the north ,
while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south .
lincoln had a highly effective campaign team who carefully projected his image as an ideal candidate . as michael martinez says :
prior to the republican convention , the lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization , the wide awakes , which it used to generate popular support for lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives , knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties . as lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew , so did his supporters . people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln because of his ideas of anti - slavery and took action to rally supporters for lincoln .
as douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns , lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches . instead , he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the republican party . the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north , and produced an abundance of campaign posters , leaflets , and newspaper editorials . there were thousands of republican speakers who focused first on the party platform , and second on lincoln's life story , emphasizing his childhood poverty . the goal was to demonstrate the superior power of " free labor ", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts . the republican party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition ; a chicago tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincoln's life , and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies .

presidency


1860 election and secession

on november 6 , 1860 , lincoln was elected the 16th president of the united states , beating douglas , breckinridge , and bell . he was the first president from the republican party . his victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the north and west ; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 southern slave states , and he won only two of 996 counties in all the southern states .
lincoln received 1,866,452 votes , douglas 1,376,957 votes , breckinridge 849,781 votes , and bell 588,789 votes . turnout was 82.2 percent , with lincoln winning the free northern states , as well as california and oregon . douglas won missouri , and split new jersey with lincoln . bell won virginia , tennessee , and kentucky , and breckinridge won the rest of the south .
although lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote , his victory in the electoral college was decisive : lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123 . there were fusion tickets in which all of lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of electors in new york , new jersey , and rhode island , but even if the anti - lincoln vote had been combined in every state , lincoln still would have won a majority in the electoral college .
as lincoln's election became evident , secessionists made clear their intent to leave the union before he took office the next march . on december 20 , 1860 , south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession ; by february 1 , 1861 , florida , mississippi , alabama , georgia , louisiana , and texas followed . six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation , the confederate states of america . the upper south and border states ( delaware , maryland , virginia , north carolina , tennessee , kentucky , missouri , and arkansas ) listened to , but initially rejected , the secessionist appeal . president buchanan and president - elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy , declaring secession illegal . the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february 9 , 1861 .
there were attempts at compromise . the crittenden compromise would have extended the missouri compromise line of 1820 , dividing the territories into slave and free , contrary to the republican party's free - soil platform . lincoln rejected the idea , saying , " i will suffer death before i consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right ."
lincoln , however , did tacitly support the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution , which passed congress before lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states . that proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that congress would not interfere with slavery without southern consent . a few weeks before the war , lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution . lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the constitution .
en route to his inauguration by train , lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north . the president - elect then evaded possible assassins in baltimore , who were uncovered by lincoln's head of security , allan pinkerton . on february 23 , 1861 , he arrived in disguise in washington , d.c ., which was placed under substantial military guard . lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south , proclaiming once again that he had no intention , or inclination , to abolish slavery in the southern states :
the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south : " we are not enemies , but friends . we must not be enemies ... the mystic chords of memory , stretching from every battlefield , and patriot grave , to every living heart and hearthstone , all over this broad land , will yet swell the chorus of the union , when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature ." the failure of the peace conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible . by march 1861 , no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms . meanwhile , lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated . lincoln said as the war was ending :

the civil war

major anderson , ft . sumter commander
the commander of fort sumter , south carolina , major robert anderson , sent a request for provisions to washington , and the execution of lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war . on april 12 , 1861 , confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter , forcing them to surrender , beginning the war . historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations : underestimating the gravity of the crisis , exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south , and not realizing the southern unionists were insisting there be no invasion .
william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was " sadly disappointed " at his failure to realize that " the country was sleeping on a volcano " and that the south was preparing for war . historian david herbert donald concludes that , " his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft . sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood . but he also vowed not to surrender the forts . the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot ; they did just that ."
on april 15 , lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts , protect washington , and " preserve the union ", which , in his view , still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states . this call forced the states to choose sides . virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the confederate capital , despite the exposed position of richmond so close to union lines . north carolina , tennessee , and arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months . secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland , but did not prevail ; kentucky tried to be neutral . the confederate attack on fort sumter rallied americans north of the mason - dixon line to the defense of the american nation . historian allan nevins says :
states sent union regiments south in response to lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion . on april 19 , mobs in baltimore , which controlled the rail links , attacked union troops who were changing trains , and local leaders ' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital . the army responded by arresting local maryland officials . lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach washington . john merryman , a maryland official involved in hindering the u.s . troop movements , petitioned supreme court chief justice and marylander , roger b . taney , author of the controversial pro - slavery dred scott opinion , to issue a writ of habeas corpus , and in june taney , acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the supreme court , issued the writ , because in his opinion only congress could suspend the writ . lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the ex parte merryman ruling .

greenbacks currency

before the civil war , the only money issued by the united states was gold and silver coins , and only such coins (" specie ") were legal tender ; that is , payment in that form had to be accepted . paper currency in the form of banknotes was issued by privately owned banks .
greenbacks were paper currency ( printed in green on the back ) issued by the united states during the american civil war , they were in two forms :
demand notes , issued in july 1861 , congress authorized 50,000,000 in demand notes . they bore no interest , but could be redeemed for specie " on demand ". they were not legal tender ( before march 1862 ), but like treasury notes could be used to pay customs duties . unlike private and state banknotes , demand notes were printed on both sides . the reverse side was printed in green ink , and so the demand notes were dubbed " greenbacks ". initially they were discounted relative to gold , but being fully redeemable in gold were soon at par . in december 1861 , the government had to suspend redemption , and they declined . chase authorized paying interest on demand notes , which sustained their value . importers therefore continued to use demand notes in place of gold . in march 1862 , demand notes were made legal tender . as demand notes were used to pay duties , they were taken out of circulation . by mid - 1863 , about 95 % of them were gone .
the other form of greenbacks where the united states notes issued in 1862 – 1865 . they were legal tender by law , but were not backed by gold or silver , only the credibility of the u.s . government . they could not be used to pay customs duties or interest on the public debt .

union military strategy

after the battle of fort sumter , lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and forming an overall union military strategy to put down the rebellion . lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis , and he responded as commander - in - chief , using unprecedented powers . he expanded his war powers , and imposed a blockade on all the confederate shipping ports , disbursed funds before appropriation by congress , and after suspending habeas corpus , arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers . lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions . in addition , lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict .
the war effort was the source of continued disparagement of lincoln , and dominated his time and attention . from the start , it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort , and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle , such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions in the union army . copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue . conversely , the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery . on august 6 , 1861 , lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederate war effort . in practice , the law had little effect , but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the confederacy .
in late august 1861 , general john c . frémont , the 1856 republican presidential nominee , issued , without consulting his superiors in washington , a proclamation of martial law in missouri . he declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court - martialed and shot , and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed . frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the department of the west compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption . lincoln overruled frémont's proclamation . lincoln believed that fremont's emancipation was political , neither militarily necessary nor legal . after lincoln acted , union enlistments from maryland , kentucky , and missouri increased by over 40,000 troops .
in foreign policy , lincoln's main goal was to stop military aid from countries abroad to the confederacy . lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his secretary of state , william seward . at times seward was too bellicose , so for balance lincoln maintained a close working relationship with senator charles sumner , the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee . the trent affair of late 1861 threatened war with great britain . the u.s . navy had illegally intercepted a british mail ship , the trent , on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys ; britain protested vehemently while the u.s . cheered . lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats . biographer james g . randall has dissected lincoln's successful techniques :
lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the war department headquarters . he kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort , consulted with governors , and selected generals based on their past success ( as well as their state and party ). in january 1862 , after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department , lincoln replaced simon cameron with edwin stanton as war secretary . stanton centralized the war department's activities , auditing and cancelling contracts , saving the federal government 17,000,000 . stanton was a staunchly unionist pro - business conservative democrat who moved toward the radical republican faction . nevertheless , he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official . " stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together ," say thomas and hyman .
in terms of war strategy , lincoln articulated two priorities : to ensure that washington was well - defended , and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the north for prompt , decisive victory ; major northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days . twice a week , lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon , and occasionally mary lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard . lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff general henry halleck , a disciple of the european strategist jomini ; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points , such as the mississippi river . lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army , rather than simply capturing territory .

general mcclellan

after the union rout at bull run , the first major battle of the civil war , and the retirement of the aged winfield scott in late 1861 , lincoln appointed major general george b . mcclellan general - in - chief of all the union armies . mcclellan , a young west point graduate , railroad executive , and pennsylvania democrat , took several months to plan and attempt his peninsula campaign , longer than lincoln wanted . the campaign's objective was to capture richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the confederate capital . mcclellan's repeated delays frustrated lincoln and congress , as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington . lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan's troops in defense of the capital ; mcclellan , who consistently overestimated the strength of confederate troops , blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign .
lincoln and george mcclellan after the battle of antietam in 1862
lincoln removed mcclellan as general - in - chief in march 1862 , after mcclellan's " harrison's landing letter ", in which he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort . the office remained empty until july , when henry halleck was selected for it . mcclellan's letter incensed radical republicans , who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope , a republican , as head of the new army of virginia . pope complied with lincoln's strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north , thus protecting the capital from attack .
however , lacking requested reinforcements from mcclellan , now commanding the army of the potomac , pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 , forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time . the war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the css virginia , formerly the uss merrimack , damaged or destroyed three union vessels in norfolk , virginia , before being engaged and damaged by the uss monitor . lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the battle of hampton roads .
despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan's failure to reinforce pope , lincoln was desperate , and restored him to command of all forces around washington , to the dismay of all in his cabinet but seward . two days after mcclellan's return to command , general robert e . lee's forces crossed the potomac river into maryland , leading to the battle of antietam in september 1862 . the ensuing union victory was among the bloodiest in american history , but it enabled lincoln to announce that he would issue an emancipation proclamation in january . having composed the proclamation some time earlier , lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation .
mcclellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue lee's retreating and exposed army , while his counterpart general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee . as a result , lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans ; and , after the 1862 midterm elections , he replaced mcclellan with republican ambrose burnside . both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the commander - in - chief .
burnside , against the advice of the president , prematurely launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was stunningly defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december . not only had burnside been defeated on the battlefield , but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined . desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after fredericksburg . lincoln brought in joseph hooker , despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship .
the mid - term elections in 1862 brought the republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war , as well as rising inflation , new high taxes , rumors of corruption , the suspension of habeas corpus , the military draft law , and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market . the emancipation proclamation announced in september gained votes for the republicans in the rural areas of new england and the upper midwest , but it lost votes in the cities and the lower midwest .
while republicans were discouraged , democrats were energized and did especially well in pennsylvania , ohio , indiana , and new york . the republicans did maintain their majorities in congress and in the major states , except new york . the cincinnati gazette contended that the voters were " depressed by the interminable nature of this war , as so far conducted , and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress ".
in the spring of 1863 , lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together ; these plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond , rosecrans on chattanooga , grant on vicksburg , and a naval assault on charleston .
hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may , but continued to command his troops for some weeks . he ignored lincoln's order to divide his troops , and possibly force lee to do the same in harper's ferry , and tendered his resignation , which lincoln accepted . he was replaced by george meade , who followed lee into pennsylvania for the gettysburg campaign , which was a victory for the union , though lee's army avoided capture . at the same time , after initial setbacks , grant laid siege to vicksburg and the union navy attained some success in charleston harbor . after the battle of gettysburg , lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his war secretary or his general - in - chief on to his generals , who resented his civilian interference with their own plans . even so , he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as commander - in - chief .

emancipation proclamation

lincoln understood that the federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the constitution , which before 1865 , committed the issue to individual states . he argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new u.s . territory . at the beginning of the war , he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery . lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it , as envisioned by the founding fathers , under the constitution . president lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by major general john c . frémont in august 1861 and by major general david hunter in may 1862 , on the grounds that it was not within their power , and it would upset the border states loyal to the union .
on june 19 , 1862 , endorsed by lincoln , congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory . in july , the confiscation act of 1862 was passed , which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion . although lincoln believed it was not within congress's power to free the slaves within the states , he approved the bill in deference to the legislature . he felt such action could only be taken by the commander - in - chief using war powers granted to the president by the constitution , and lincoln was planning to take that action . in that month , lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet . in it , he stated that " as a fit and necessary military measure , on january 1 , 1863 , all persons held as slaves in the confederate states will thenceforward , and forever , be free ".
privately , lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the confederacy had to be eliminated . however , copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification . republican editor horace greeley of the highly influential new york tribune fell for the ploy , and lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of august 22 , 1862 . although he said he personally wished all men could be free , lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the u.s . president ( he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his " official duty ") was that of preserving the union :
the emancipation proclamation , issued on september 22 , 1862 , and put into effect on january 1 , 1863 , declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under union control , with exemptions specified for areas already under union control in two states . lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation , while democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off - year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites .
once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective , as union armies advanced south , more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in confederate territory were freed . lincoln's comment on the signing of the proclamation was : " i never , in my life , felt more certain that i was doing right , than i do in signing this paper ." for some time , lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves . he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation , but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed . a few days after emancipation was announced , 13 republican governors met at the war governors ' conference ; they supported the president's proclamation , but suggested the removal of general george b . mcclellan as commander of the union army .
enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the emancipation proclamation . by the spring of 1863 , lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers . in a letter to andrew johnson , the military governor of tennessee , encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops , lincoln wrote , " the bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once ". by the end of 1863 , at lincoln's direction , general lorenzo thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley . frederick douglass once observed of lincoln : " in his company , i was never reminded of my humble origin , or of my unpopular color ".

gettysburg address ( 1863 )

with the great union victory at the battle of gettysburg in july 1863 , and the defeat of the copperheads in the ohio election in the fall , lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort , despite the new york city draft riots . the stage was set for his address at the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november 19 , 1863 . defying lincoln's prediction that " the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here ", the address became the most quoted speech in american history .
in 272 words , and three minutes , lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789 , but in 1776 , " conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal ". he defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all . the emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort . he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain , that slavery would end as a result of the losses , and the future of democracy in the world would be assured , that " government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth ". lincoln concluded that the civil war had a profound objective : a new birth of freedom in the nation .

general grant

meade's failure to capture lee's army as it retreated from gettysburg , and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac , persuaded lincoln that a change in command was needed . general ulysses s . grant's victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln and made grant a strong candidate to head the union army . responding to criticism of grant after shiloh , lincoln had said , " i can't spare this man . he fights ." with grant in command , lincoln felt the union army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters , and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops .
nevertheless , lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a candidacy for president in 1864 , as mcclellan was . lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into grant's political intentions , and being assured that he had none , submitted to the senate grant's promotion to commander of the union army . he obtained congress's consent to reinstate for grant the rank of lieutenant general , which no officer had held since george washington .
grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 . this is often characterized as a war of attrition , given high union losses at battles such as the battle of the wilderness and cold harbor . even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive , the confederate forces had " almost as high a percentage of casualties as the union forces ". the high casualty figures of the union alarmed the north ; grant had lost a third of his army , and lincoln asked what grant's plans were , to which the general replied , " i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer ."
the confederacy lacked reinforcements , so lee's army shrank with every costly battle . grant's army moved south , crossed the james river , forcing a siege and trench warfare outside petersburg , virginia . lincoln then made an extended visit to grant's headquarters at city point , virginia . this allowed the president to confer in person with grant and william tecumseh sherman about the hostilities , as sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to grant from his position in north carolina . lincoln and the republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the north , and replaced the union losses .
lincoln authorized grant to target the confederate infrastructure — such as plantations , railroads , and bridges — hoping to destroy the south's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting . grant's move to petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between richmond and the south . this strategy allowed generals sherman and philip sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in virginia's shenandoah valley . the damage caused by sherman's march to the sea through georgia in 1864 was limited to a swath , but neither lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal , but rather defeat of the confederate armies . mark e . neely jr . has argued that there was no effort to engage in " total war " against civilians which he believed did take place during world war ii .
confederate general jubal early began a series of assaults in the north that threatened the capital . during early's raid on washington , d.c . in 1864 , lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position ; captain oliver wendell holmes shouted at him , " get down , you damn fool , before you get shot !" after repeated calls on grant to defend washington , sheridan was appointed and the threat from early was dispatched .
as grant continued to wear down lee's forces , efforts to discuss peace began . confederate vice president stephens led a group to meet with lincoln , seward , and others at hampton roads . lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the confederacy as a coequal ; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results . on april 1 , 1865 , grant successfully outflanked lee's forces in the battle of five forks and nearly encircled petersburg , and the confederate government evacuated richmond . days later , when that city fell , lincoln visited the vanquished confederate capital ; as he walked through the city , white southerners were stone - faced , but freedmen greeted him as a hero . on april 9 , lee surrendered to grant at appomattox and the war was effectively over .

1864 re - election

while the war was still being waged , lincoln faced reelection in 1864 . lincoln was a master politician , bringing together — and holding together — all the main factions of the republican party , and bringing in war democrats such as edwin m . stanton and andrew johnson as well . lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers — greatly expanded over peacetime — to hold the factions of his party together , build support for his own policies , and fend off efforts by radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket . at its 1864 convention , the republican party selected johnson , a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee , as his running mate . to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans , lincoln ran under the label of the new union party .
when grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and union casualties mounted , the lack of military success wore heavily on the president's re - election prospects , and many republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated . sharing this fear , lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that , if he should lose the election , he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house :
lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet , but asked them to sign the sealed envelope .
while the democratic platform followed the " peace wing " of the party and called the war a " failure ", their candidate , general george b . mcclellan , supported the war and repudiated the platform . lincoln provided grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of grant in the war effort . sherman's capture of atlanta in september and david farragut's capture of mobile ended defeatist jitters ; the democratic party was deeply split , with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln . by contrast , the national union party was united and energized as lincoln made emancipation the central issue , and state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads . on november 8 , lincoln was re - elected in a landslide , carrying all but three states , and receiving 78 percent of the union soldiers ' vote .
on march 4 , 1865 , lincoln delivered his second inaugural address . in it , he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be god's will . historian mark noll concludes it ranks " among the small handful of semi - sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world ". lincoln said :

reconstruction

reconstruction began during the war , as lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states , and how to determine the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves . shortly after lee's surrender , a general had asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated , and lincoln replied , " let ' em up easy ." in keeping with that sentiment , lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy , and was opposed by the radical republicans , under rep . thaddeus stevens , sen . charles sumner and sen . benjamin wade , political allies of the president on other issues . determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south , lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war . his amnesty proclamation of december 8 , 1863 , offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office , had not mistreated union prisoners , and would sign an oath of allegiance .
a political cartoon of vice president andrew johnson ( a former tailor ) and lincoln , 1865 , entitled the ' rail splitter ' at work repairing the union . the caption reads ( johnson ): " take it quietly uncle abe and i will draw it closer than ever ." ( lincoln ): " a few more stitches andy and the good old union will be mended ."
as southern states were subdued , critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re - formed . of special importance were tennessee and arkansas , where lincoln appointed generals andrew johnson and frederick steele as military governors , respectively . in louisiana , lincoln ordered general nathaniel p . banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it . lincoln's democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the republicans ' political aspirations . on the other hand , the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient , and passed their own plan , the wade - davis bill , in 1864 . when lincoln vetoed the bill , the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana , arkansas , and tennessee .
lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and radical factions in harness . to fill chief justice taney's seat on the supreme court , he named the choice of the radicals , salmon p . chase , who lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies .
after implementing the emancipation proclamation , which did not apply to every state , lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment . lincoln declared that such an amendment would " clinch the whole matter ". by december 1863 , a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to congress for passage . this first attempt at an amendment failed to pass , falling short of the required two - thirds majority on june 15 , 1864 , in the house of representatives . passage of the proposed amendment became part of the republican / unionist platform in the election of 1864 . after a long debate in the house , a second attempt passed congress on january 31 , 1865 , and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification . upon ratification , it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december 6 , 1865 .
as the war drew to a close , lincoln's presidential reconstruction for the south was in flux ; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen . he signed into law senator charles sumner's freedmen's bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves . the law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen . lincoln stated that his louisiana plan did not apply to all states under reconstruction . shortly before his assassination , lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern reconstruction . discussions with his cabinet revealed lincoln planned short - term military control over southern states , until readmission under the control of southern unionists .
historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what lincoln would have done about reconstruction if he had lived , but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen . lincoln biographers james g . randall and richard current , according to david lincove , argue that :
eric foner argues that :

redefining the republic and republicanism

the successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country . the term " the united states " has historically been used , sometimes in the plural (" these united states "), and other times in the singular , without any particular grammatical consistency . the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century .
in recent years , historians such as harry jaffa , herman belz , john diggins , vernon burton and eric foner have stressed lincoln's redefinition of republican values . as early as the 1850s , a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution , lincoln redirected emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political values — what he called the " sheet anchor " of republicanism . the declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all , in contrast to the constitution's tolerance of slavery , shifted the debate . as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech of early 1860 , " lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself ." his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism , rather than its legalisms . nevertheless , in 1861 , lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms ( the constitution was a contract , and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree ), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state . burton ( 2008 ) argues that lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the freedmen as they were emancipated .
in march 1861 , in lincoln's first inaugural address , he explored the nature of democracy . he denounced secession as anarchy , and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the american system . he said " a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations , and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments , is the only true sovereign of a free people ."

other enactments

lincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency , which gave congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the executive enforced them . lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by congress ; the only important one was the wade - davis bill with its harsh program of reconstruction . he signed the homestead act in 1862 , making millions of acres of government - held land in the west available for purchase at very low cost . the morrill land - grant colleges act , also signed in 1862 , provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state . the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states ' first transcontinental railroad , which was completed in 1869 . the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was made possible by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s .
other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the federal government : tariffs ( a policy with long precedent ), and a new federal income tax . in 1861 , lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariff , the first having become law under james buchanan . also in 1861 , lincoln signed the revenue act of 1861 , creating the first u.s . income tax . this created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above 800 ( in current dollar terms ), which was later changed by the revenue act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure .
lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas . the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking act provided a strong financial network in the country . it also established a national currency . in 1862 , congress created , with lincoln's approval , the department of agriculture . in 1862 , lincoln sent a senior general , john pope , to put down the " sioux uprising " in minnesota . presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted santee dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers , lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants , eventually approving 39 for execution ( one was later reprieved ). president lincoln had planned to reform federal indian policy .
in the wake of grant's casualties in his campaign against lee , lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft , but it was never issued . in response to rumors of one , however , the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market . lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior ; he ordered the military to seize the two papers . the seizure lasted for two days .
lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the thanksgiving holiday in the united states . before lincoln's presidency , thanksgiving , while a regional holiday in new england since the 17th century , had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates . the last such proclamation had been during james madison's presidency 50 years before . in 1863 , lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving . in june 1864 , lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress , which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park .

judicial appointments


supreme court appointments

noah haynes swayne – 1862
samuel freeman miller – 1862
david davis – 1862
stephen johnson field – 1863
salmon portland chase – 1864 ( chief justice )
lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that " we cannot ask a man what he will do , and if we should , and he should answer us , we should despise him for it . therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known ." lincoln made five appointments to the united states supreme court . noah haynes swayne , nominated january 21 , 1862 , and appointed january 24 , 1862 , was chosen as an anti - slavery lawyer who was committed to the union . samuel freeman miller , nominated and appointed on july 16 , 1862 , supported lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist . david davis , lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 , nominated december 1 , 1862 , and appointed december 8 , 1862 , had also served as a judge in lincoln's illinois court circuit . stephen johnson field , a previous california supreme court justice , was nominated march 6 , 1863 , and appointed march 10 , 1863 , and provided geographic balance , as well as political balance to the court as a democrat . finally , lincoln's treasury secretary , salmon p . chase , was nominated as chief justice , and appointed the same day , on december 6 , 1864 . lincoln believed chase was an able jurist , would support reconstruction legislation , and that his appointment united the republican party .

other judicial appointments

lincoln appointed 32 federal judges , including four associate justices and one chief justice to the supreme court of the united states , and 27 judges to the united states district courts . lincoln appointed no judges to the united states circuit courts during his time in office .

states admitted to the union

west virginia , admitted to the union june 20 , 1863 , contained the former north - westernmost counties of virginia that seceded from virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the union . as a condition for its admission , west virginia's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery . nevada , which became the third state in the far - west of the continent , was admitted as a free state on october 31 , 1864 .

assassination and funeral

abraham lincoln was assassinated by john wilkes booth on good friday , april 14 , 1865 , while attending a play at ford's theatre as the american civil war was drawing to a close . the assassination occurred five days after the surrender of robert e . lee and the confederate army of northern virginia . booth was a well - known actor and a confederate spy from maryland ; though he never joined the confederate army , he had contacts with the confederate secret service . in 1864 , booth formulated a plan ( very similar to one of thomas n . conrad previously authorized by the confederacy ) to kidnap lincoln in exchange for the release of confederate prisoners . after attending an april 11 , 1865 , speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks , an incensed booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president . learning that the president and grant would be attending ford's theatre , booth formulated a plan with co - conspirators to assassinate lincoln and grant at the theater , as well as vice president johnson and secretary of state seward at their homes . without his main bodyguard , ward hill lamon , lincoln left to attend the play our american cousin on april 14 . at the last minute , grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play .
lincoln's bodyguard , john parker , left ford's theater during intermission to drink at the saloon next door . the now unguarded president sat in his state box in the balcony . seizing the opportunity , booth crept up from behind and at about 10 : 13 pm , aimed at the back of lincoln's head and fired at point - blank range , mortally wounding the president . major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth , but booth stabbed him and escaped .
after being on the run for 12 days , booth was tracked down and found on a farm in virginia , some south of washington . after refusing to surrender to union troops , booth was killed by sergeant boston corbett on april 26 .
doctor charles leale , an army surgeon , found the president unresponsive , barely breathing and with no detectable pulse . having determined that the president had been shot in the head , and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought , he made an attempt to clear the blood clot , after which the president began to breathe more naturally . the dying president was taken across the street to petersen house . after remaining in a coma for nine hours , lincoln died at 7 : 22 am on april 15 . according to eyewitnesses , his face was fixed in a smile when he expired . secretary of war stanton saluted and said , " now he belongs to the ages ."
lincoln's flag - enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the white house by bareheaded union officers , while the city's church bells rang . president johnson was sworn in at 10 : 00 am , less than 3 hours after lincoln's death . the late president lay in state in the east room , and then in the capitol rotunda from april 19 through april 21 . for his final journey with his son willie , both caskets were transported in the executive coach " united states " and for three weeks the lincoln special funeral train decorated in black bunting bore lincoln's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from washington d.c . to springfield , illinois , stopping at many cities across the north for large - scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands , as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands , bonfires , and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by . poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd to eulogize lincoln , one of four poems he wrote about the assassinated president . historians have emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow , but also noted that some lincoln haters cheered when they heard the news . african - americans were especially moved ; they had lost ' their moses '. in a larger sense , the outpouring of grief and anguish was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war that had just ended .

religious and philosophical beliefs

as a young man , lincoln was a religious skeptic , or , in the words of a biographer , an iconoclast . later in life , lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences , who were mostly evangelical protestants . he never joined a church , although he frequently attended with his wife . however , he was deeply familiar with the bible , and he both quoted and praised it . he was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others . lincoln never made a clear profession of christian beliefs . however , he did believe in an all - powerful god that shaped events and , by 1865 , was expressing those beliefs in major speeches .
in the 1840s , lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity , a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power . in the 1850s , lincoln believed in " providence " in a general way , and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals ; he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence . when he suffered the death of his son edward , lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on god . the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace . after willie's death , lincoln considered why , from a divine standpoint , the severity of the war was necessary . he wrote at this time that god " could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest . yet the contest began . and having begun , he could give the final victory to either side any day . yet the contest proceeds ." on the day lincoln was assassinated , he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land .

health

several claims have been made that lincoln's health was declining before the assassination . these are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting . one such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder , men2b , which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma , mucosal neuromas and a marfanoid appearance . others simply claim he had marfan syndrome , based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers , and the association of possible aortic regurgitation , which can cause bobbing of the head ( demusset's sign ) – based on blurring of lincoln's head in photographs , which back then had a long exposure time . confirmation of this and other diseases could possibly be obtained via dna analysis of a pillow case stained with lincoln's blood , currently in possession of the grand army of the republic museum & library in philadelphia , but , the museum has refused to provide a sample for testing .

historical reputation

in surveys of u.s . scholars ranking presidents conducted since the 1940s , lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three , often as number one . a 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one , while legal scholars placed him second after george washington . in presidential ranking polls conducted in the united states since 1948 , lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls . generally , the top three presidents are rated as 1 . lincoln ; 2 . washington ; and 3 . franklin delano roosevelt , although lincoln and washington , and washington and roosevelt , are occasionally reversed .
president lincoln's assassination increased his status to the point of making him a national martyr . lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty . republicans linked lincoln's name to their party . many , though not all , in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability . historians have said he was " a classical liberal " in the 19th century sense . allen c . guelzo states that lincoln was a
lincoln became a favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across europe and latin america and even in asia .
schwartz argues that lincoln's american reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the progressive era ( 1900 – 1920s ) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in american history , with even white southerners in agreement . the high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington , d.c . in the new deal era , liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self - made man or the great war president , but as the advocate of the common man who they believed would have supported the welfare state . in the cold war years , lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes .
by the 1970s lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism , support for business , his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage , his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition , and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers . as a whig activist , lincoln was a spokesman for business interests , favoring high tariffs , banks , internal improvements , and railroads in opposition to the agrarian democrats . william c . harris found that lincoln's " reverence for the founding fathers , the constitution , the laws under it , and the preservation of the republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism ". james g . randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation " in his preference for orderly progress , his distrust of dangerous agitation , and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform ". randall concludes that , " he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so - called ' radicalism ' which involved abuse of the south , hatred for the slaveholder , thirst for vengeance , partisan plotting , and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders ."
by the late 1960s , some african american intellectuals , led by lerone bennett jr ., rejected lincoln's role as the great emancipator . bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in 1968 . he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks . bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality , and proposed sending freed slaves to another country . defenders , such as authors dirck and cashin , retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day ; and that he was a " moral visionary " who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause , as fast as politically possible . the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery , or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation . historian barry schwartz wrote in 2009 that lincoln's image suffered " erosion , fading prestige , benign ridicule " in the late 20th century . on the other hand , donald opined in his 1996 biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability , defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were " content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts , and not compelled toward fact or reason ". in the 21st century , president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using lincoln's bible for his swearing in to office at both his inaugurations .

memory and memorials

lincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency , the penny and the 5 bill . his likeness also appears on many postage stamps and he has been memorialized in many town , city , and county names , including the capital of nebraska . while he is usually portrayed bearded , he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11 - year - old grace bedell .

the most famous and most visited memorials are lincoln's sculpture on mount rushmore ; lincoln memorial , ford's theatre , and petersen house ( where he died ) in washington , d.c .; and the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum in springfield , illinois , not far from lincoln's home , as well as his tomb .
barry schwartz , a sociologist who has examined america's cultural memory , argues that in the 1930s and 1940s , the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with " a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life ". during the great depression , he argues , lincoln served " as a means for seeing the world's disappointments , for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful ". franklin d . roosevelt , preparing america for war , used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan . americans asked , " what would lincoln do ?" however , schwartz also finds that since world war ii , lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance , and this " fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness ". he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept .
the united states navy is named after lincoln , the second navy ship to bear his name .

aristotle
aristotle (; aristotélēs , ; 384 – 322 bc ) was an ancient greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of stagira , chalkidiki , in the north of classical greece . along with plato , he is considered the " father of western philosophy ". aristotle provided a complex and harmonious synthesis of the various existing philosophies prior to him , including those of socrates and plato , and it was above all from his teachings that the west inherited its fundamental intellectual lexicon , as well as problems and methods of inquiry . as a result , his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the west and it continues to be central to the contemporary philosophical discussion .
little is known about his life . his father , nicomachus , died when aristotle was a child , and he was brought up by a guardian . at seventeen or eighteen years of age , he joined plato's academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty - seven ( c . 347 bc ). his writings cover many subjects – including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theatre , music , rhetoric , psychology , linguistics , economics , politics and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of western philosophy . shortly after plato died , aristotle left athens and , at the request of philip ii of macedon , tutored alexander the great beginning in 343 bc . teaching alexander gave aristotle many opportunities . he established a library in the lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books , which were papyrus scrolls . the fact that aristotle was a pupil of plato contributed to his former views of platonism , but , following plato's death , aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from platonism to empiricism . he believed all concepts and knowledge were ultimately based on perception . aristotle's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works .
aristotle's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship . their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance , and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics . some of aristotle's zoological observations , such as on the hectocotyl ( reproductive ) arm of the octopus , were disbelieved until the 19th century . his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and john buridan . aristotelianism profoundly influenced islamic thought during the middle ages , as well as christian theology , especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church . aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as " the first teacher ". his ethics , though always influential , gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics .
all aspects of aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of academic study . though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication , only around a third of his original output has survived , none of it intended for publication . aristotle has been depicted by major artists including raphael and rembrandt . early modern theories including william harvey's circulation of the blood and galileo galilei's kinematics were developed in reaction to aristotle's . in the 19th century , george boole gave aristotle's logic a mathematical foundation with his system of algebraic logic . in the 20th century , martin heidegger created a new interpretation of aristotle's political philosophy , but elsewhere aristotle was widely criticised , even ridiculed by thinkers such as the philosopher bertrand russell and the biologist peter medawar . more recently , aristotle has again been taken seriously , such as in the thinking of ayn rand and alasdair macintyre , while armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotle's biology . the image of aristotle tutoring the young alexander remains current , and the poetics continues to play a role in the cinema of the united states .

life

in general , the details of aristotle's life are not well - established . the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points .
aristotle , whose name means " the best purpose " in ancient greek , was born in 384 bc in stagira , chalcidice , about 55 km ( 34 miles ) east of modern - day thessaloniki . his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon . both of aristotle's parents died when he was about thirteen , and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian . although little information about aristotle's childhood has survived , he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace , making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy .
at the age of seventeen or eighteen , aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato's academy . he remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving athens in 348 / 47 bc . the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academy's direction after control passed to plato's nephew speusippus , although it is possible that he feared the anti - macedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died . aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor . after the death of hermias , aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos , where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon . while in lesbos , aristotle married pythias , either hermias's adoptive daughter or niece . she bore him a daughter , whom they also named pythias . in 343 bc , aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander .
aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon . during aristotle's time in the macedonian court , he gave lessons not only to alexander , but also to two other future kings : ptolemy and cassander . aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and aristotle's own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric . in one famous example , he counsels alexander to be " a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians , to look after the former as after friends and relatives , and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants ". by 335 bc , aristotle had returned to athens , establishing his own school there known as the lyceum . aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years . while in athens , his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira , who bore him a son whom he named after his father , nicomachus . according to the suda , he also had an erômenos , palaephatus of abydus .
this period in athens , between 335 and 323 bc , is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works . he wrote many dialogues , of which only fragments have survived . those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not , for the most part , intended for widespread publication ; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students . his most important treatises include physics , metaphysics , nicomachean ethics , politics , on the soul and poetics . aristotle studied and made significant contributions to " logic , metaphysics , mathematics , physics , biology , botany , ethics , politics , agriculture , medicine , dance and theatre ."
near the end of his life , alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander's relationship with persia and persians . a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexander's death , but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death . following alexander's death , anti - macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled . in 322 bc , demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety , prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in chalcis , on euboea , at which occasion he was said to have stated : " i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy " – a reference to athens's trial and execution of socrates . he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year , having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife .

abstract philosophy


logic

with the prior analytics , aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic , and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until 19th - century advances in mathematical logic . kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion .

analytics and the organon

what we today call aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism ( methods of logical argument ), aristotle himself would have labelled " analytics ". the term " logic " he reserved to mean dialectics . most of aristotle's work is probably not in its original form , because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers . the logical works of aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the organon around 40 bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers . the books are :
categories
on interpretation
prior analytics
posterior analytics
topics
on sophistical refutations
the order of the books ( or the teachings from which they are composed ) is not certain , but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle's writings . it goes from the basics , the analysis of simple terms in the categories , the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation , to the study of more complex forms , namely , syllogisms ( in the analytics ) and dialectics ( in the topics and sophistical refutations ). the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu : the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning . the rhetoric is not conventionally included , but it states that it relies on the topics .

epistemology

like his teacher plato , aristotle's philosophy aims at the universal . aristotle's ontology places the universal ( katholou ) in particulars ( kath ' hekaston ), things in the world , whereas for plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate . this means that aristotle's epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world , and rises to knowledge of the universal , whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms ( or ideas ) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these . for aristotle , " form " is still what phenomena are based on , but is " instantiated " in a particular substance . aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction , whereas plato relies on deduction from a priori principles .
in aristotle's terminology , " natural philosophy " is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world , and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics , biology and other natural sciences . aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry . aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning , which he also would describe as " science ". note , however , that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term " scientific method ". for aristotle , " all science ( dianoia ) is either practical , poetical or theoretical " ( metaphysics 1025b25 ). his practical science includes ethics and politics ; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry ; his theoretical science covers physics , mathematics and metaphysics .

metaphysics

the word " metaphysics " appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotle's works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics . aristotle called it " first philosophy ", and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science ( physics ) as the contemplative ( theoretikē ) philosophy which is " theological " and studies the divine . he wrote in his metaphysics ( 1026a16 ):

substance , potentiality and actuality

aristotle examines the concepts of substance ( ousia ) and essence ( to ti ên einai , " the what it was to be ") in his metaphysics ( book vii ), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form , a philosophical theory called hylomorphism . in book viii , he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum , or the stuff of which it is composed . for example , the matter of a house is the bricks , stones , timbers etc ., or whatever constitutes the potential house , while the form of the substance is the actual house , namely ' covering for bodies and chattels ' or any other differentia that let us define something as a house . the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter , and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form .
with regard to the change ( kinesis ) and its causes now , as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption 319b – 320a , he distinguishes the coming to be from :
growth and diminution , which is change in quantity ;
locomotion , which is change in space ; and
alteration , which is change in quality .
the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property . in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality ( dynamis ) and actuality ( entelecheia ) in association with the matter and the form . referring to potentiality , this is what a thing is capable of doing , or being acted upon , if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else . for example , the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially ( dynamei ) plant , and if is not prevented by something , it will become a plant . potentially beings can either ' act ' ( poiein ) or ' be acted upon ' ( paschein ), which can be either innate or learned . for example , the eyes possess the potentiality of sight ( innate – being acted upon ), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning ( exercise – acting ). actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality . because the end ( telos ) is the principle of every change , and for the sake of the end exists potentiality , therefore actuality is the end . referring then to our previous example , we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do .
in summary , the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities , which is also a final cause or end . then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula , in time and in substantiality . with this definition of the particular substance ( i.e ., matter and form ), aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings , for example , " what is it that makes a man one "? since , according to plato there are two ideas : animal and biped , how then is man a unity ? however , according to aristotle , the potential being ( matter ) and the actual one ( form ) are one and the same .

universals and particulars

plato argued that all things have a universal form , which could be either a property or a relation to other things . when we look at an apple , for example , we see an apple , and we can also analyse a form of an apple . in this distinction , there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple . moreover , we can place an apple next to a book , so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other . plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things . for example , it is possible that there is no particular good in existence , but " good " is still a proper universal form . aristotle disagreed with plato on this point , arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time , and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things . in addition , aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals . where plato spoke of the world of forms , a place where all universal forms subsist , aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated . so , according to aristotle , the form of apple exists within each apple , rather than in the world of the forms .

natural philosophy

aristotle's " natural philosophy " spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics , biology and other natural sciences .

physics


five elements

in his on generation and corruption , aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by empedocles , earth , water , air , and fire , to two of the four sensible qualities , hot , cold , wet , and dry . in the empedoclean scheme , all matter was made of the four elements , in differing proportions . aristotle's scheme added the heavenly aether , the divine substance of the heavenly spheres , stars and planets .

motion

aristotle describes two kinds of motion : " violent " or " unnatural motion ", such as that of a thrown stone , in the physics ( 254b10 ), and " natural motion ", such as of a falling object , in on the heavens ( 300a20 ). in violent motion , as soon as the agent stops causing it , the motion stops also ; in other words , the natural state of an object is to be at rest , since aristotle does not address friction . with this understanding , it can be observed that , as aristotle stated , heavy objects ( on the ground , say ) require more force to make them move ; and objects pushed with greater force move faster . this would imply the equation
,
incorrect in modern physics .
natural motion depends on the element concerned : the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens , while the 4 empedoclean elements move vertically up ( like fire , as is observed ) or down ( like earth ) towards their natural resting places .
in the physics ( 215a25 ), aristotle effectively states a quantitative law , that the speed , v , of a falling body is proportional ( say , with constant c ) to its weight , w , and inversely proportional to the density , ρ , of the fluid in which it is falling :
:
aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite , and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible . opinions have varied on whether aristotle intended to state quantitative laws . henri carteron held the " extreme view " that aristotle's concept of force was basically qualitative , but other authors reject this .
archimedes corrected aristotle's theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places ; metal boats can float if they displace enough water ; floating depends in archimedes ' scheme on the mass and volume of the object , not as aristotle thought its elementary composition .
aristotle's writings on motion remained influential until the early modern period . john philoponus ( in the middle ages ) and galileo are said to have shown by experiment that aristotle's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect . a contrary opinion is given by carlo rovelli , who argues that aristotle's physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity , that of objects in the earth's gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air . in this system , heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones ( whether friction is ignored , or not ), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium .
newton's " forced " motion corresponds to aristotle's " violent " motion with its external agent , but aristotle's assumption that the agent's effect stops immediately it stops acting ( e.g ., the ball leaves the thrower's hand ) has awkward consequences : he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it , resulting in the medieval theory of impetus .

four causes

aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors . his term aitia is traditionally translated as " cause ", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence ; it might be better translated as " explanation ", but the traditional rendering will be employed here .
material cause describes the material out of which something is composed . thus the material cause of a table is wood . it is not about action . it does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino .
the formal cause is its form , i.e ., the arrangement of that matter . it tells us what a thing is , that a thing is determined by the definition , form , pattern , essence , whole , synthesis or archetype . it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws , as the whole ( i.e ., macrostructure ) is the cause of its parts , a relationship known as the whole - part causation . plainly put , the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being . a simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist , architect , or engineer to create a drawing .
the efficient cause is " the primary source ", or that from which the change under consideration proceeds . it identifies ' what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed ' and so suggests all sorts of agents , nonliving or living , acting as the sources of change or movement or rest . representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect , this covers the modern definitions of " cause " as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs . in the case of two dominoes , when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over . in the case of animals , this agency is a combination of how it develops from the egg , and how its body functions .
the final cause ( telos ) is its purpose , the reason why a thing exists or is done , including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities . the final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve . this covers modern ideas of motivating causes , such as volition . in the case of living things , it implies adaptation to a particular way of life .

optics

aristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in problems , book 15 . the apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in . with it , he saw that whatever shape he made the hole , the sun's image always remained circular . he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image .

chance and spontaneity

according to aristotle , spontaneity and chance are causes of some things , distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity . chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things , " from what is spontaneous ". there is also more a specific kind of chance , which aristotle names " luck ", that only applies to people's moral choices .

astronomy

in astronomy , aristotle refuted democritus's claim that the milky way was made up of " those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays ," pointing out correctly that if " the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun , then ... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them ."

geology

aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations . he stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one person's lifetime .
the geologist charles lyell noted that aristotle described such change , including " lakes that had dried up " and " deserts that had become watered by rivers ", giving as examples the growth of the nile delta since the time of homer , and " the upheaving of one of the aeolian islands , previous to a volcanic eruption ."'

biology


empirical research

aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically , and biology forms a large part of his writings . he spent two years observing and describing the zoology of lesbos and the surrounding seas , including in particular the pyrrha lagoon in the centre of lesbos . his data in history of animals , generation of animals , movement of animals , and parts of animals are assembled from his own observations , statements given by people with specialised knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen , and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas . his apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident : his works on botany have been lost , but two books on plants by his pupil theophrastus have survived .
aristotle reports on the sea - life visible from observation on lesbos and the catches of fishermen . he describes the catfish , electric ray , and frogfish in detail , as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus . his description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods , used in sexual reproduction , was widely disbelieved until the 19th century . he gives accurate descriptions of the four - chambered fore - stomachs of ruminants , and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark .
he notes that an animal's structure is well matched to function , so , among birds , the heron , which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish , has a long neck and long legs , and a sharp spear - like beak , whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet . darwin , too , noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal , but unlike aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution . aristotle's writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution , but while aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridisations could occur , he saw these as rare accidents . for aristotle , accidents , like heat waves in winter , must be considered distinct from natural causes . he was thus critical of empedocles's materialist theory of a " survival of the fittest " origin of living things and their organs , and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results . to put his views into modern terms , he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor , or that one kind can change into another , or that kinds can become extinct .

scientific style

aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense . he used the ancient greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations , or at most investigative procedures like dissection . in generation of animals , he finds a fertilised hen's egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo's heart beating inside .
instead , he practised a different style of science : systematically gathering data , discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals , and inferring possible causal explanations from these . this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field , such as genomics . it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science , but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed . in this sense , aristotle's biology is scientific .
from the data he collected and documented , aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life - history features of the live - bearing tetrapods ( terrestrial placental mammals ) that he studied . among these correct predictions are the following . brood size decreases with ( adult ) body mass , so that an elephant has fewer young ( usually just one ) per brood than a mouse . lifespan increases with gestation period , and also with body mass , so that elephants live longer than mice , have a longer period of gestation , and are heavier . as a final example , fecundity decreases with lifespan , so long - lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short - lived kinds like mice .

classification of living things

aristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals , arranging these in the history of animals in a graded scale of perfection , a scala naturae , with man at the top . his system had eleven grades of animal , from highest potential to lowest , expressed in their form at birth : the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures , the lowest laid cold , dry mineral - like eggs . animals came above plants , and these in turn were above minerals . he grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter " animals with blood ", and below them the colder invertebrates as " animals without blood ". those with blood were divided into the live - bearing ( mammals ), and the egg - laying ( birds , reptiles , fish ). those without blood were insects , crustacea ( non - shelled – cephalopods , and shelled ) and the hard - shelled molluscs ( bivalves and gastropods ). he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale , and noted various exceptions , such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods . to a modern biologist , the explanation , not available to aristotle , is convergent evolution . he believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes ; this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design .

psychology


soul

aristotle's psychology , given in his treatise on the soul ( peri psychēs ), posits three kinds of soul (" psyches "): the vegetative soul , the sensitive soul , and the rational soul . humans have a rational soul . the human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds : like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself ; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally . the unique part of the human , rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous ( intellect ) and logos ( reason ).
for aristotle , the soul is the form of a living being . because all beings are composites of form and matter , the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings , e.g . the ability to initiate movement ( or in the case of plants , growth and chemical transformations , which aristotle considers types of movement ). in contrast to earlier philosophers , but in accordance with the egyptians , he placed the rational soul in the heart , rather than the brain . notable is aristotle's division of sensation and thought , which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers , with the exception of alcmaeon .

memory

according to aristotle in on the soul , memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal " appearance " and an occurrence in the past . in other words , a memory is a mental picture ( phantasm ) that can be recovered . aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi - fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory . a memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once . these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation , aristotelian ' common sense ', and thinking .
aristotle uses the term ' memory ' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation , and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents . memory is of the past , prediction is of the future , and sensation is of the present . retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly . a transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences , both for our previous experience and present experience .
because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions , people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences . to search for these impressions , people search the memory itself . within the memory , if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory , that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for . recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another . if the chain of " images " is needed , one memory will stimulate the next . when people recall experiences , they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed . recollection is thus the self - directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression . only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity , such as numbers and words . animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations . remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed .
aristotle believed the chain of thought , which ends in recollection of certain impressions , was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity , contrast , and contiguity , described in his laws of association . aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind . a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience . according to aristotle , association is the power innate in a mental state , which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences , allowing them to rise and be recalled .

dreams

aristotle describes sleep in on sleep and wakefulness . sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion , so it is vital to the body . while a person is asleep , the critical activities , which include thinking , sensing , recalling and remembering , do not function as they do during wakefulness . since a person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire , which is the result of sensation . however , the senses are able to work during sleep , albeit differently , unless they are weary .
dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus . in dreams , sensation is still involved , but in an altered manner . aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water , and then look away , the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion . when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention , it leaves an impression . when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly , a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored . however , during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences . so , dreams result from these lasting impressions . since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli , dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience . during sleep , a person is in an altered state of mind . aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus . for example , a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings . since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements , they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams , like the infatuated person . this leads the person to believe the dream is real , even when the dreams are absurd in nature .
one component of aristotle's theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs . he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being . aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences . aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it . if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred . secondly , any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream . for example , if , while a person is sleeping , a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut , this sensory experience is not part of the dream . lastly , the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences .

practical philosophy

aristotle's practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics , politics , economics , and rhetoric .

ethics

aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study , i.e ., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake . he wrote several treatises on ethics , including most notably , the nicomachean ethics .
aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ( ergon ) of a thing . an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see , because the proper function of an eye is sight . aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans , and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē ( soul ) in accordance with reason ( logos ). aristotle identified such an optimum activity ( the virtuous mean , between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency ) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action , eudaimonia , generally translated as " happiness " or sometimes " well being ". to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ( ēthikē aretē ), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence .
aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately , but by teachers , and experience , leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things . when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom ( phronesis ) and their intellect ( nous ) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue , the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker , or in other words , a philosopher .

politics

in addition to his works on ethics , which address the individual , aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics . aristotle considered the city to be a natural community . moreover , he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual , " for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part ". he also famously stated that " man is by nature a political animal " and also arguing that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality . aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine , and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others . aristotle's conception of the city is organic , and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner .
the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotle's understanding . although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires , the natural community according to aristotle was the city ( polis ) which functions as a political " community " or " partnership " ( koinōnia ). the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability , but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life , and to perform beautiful acts : " the political partnership must be regarded , therefore , as being for the sake of noble actions , not for the sake of living together ." this is distinguished from modern approaches , beginning with social contract theory , according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of " fear of violent death " or its " inconveniences ."
in protrepticus , the character ' aristotle ' states :

economics

aristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought , especially to thought in the middle ages . in politics , aristotle addresses the city , property , and trade . his response to criticisms of private property , in lionel robbins's view , anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists , as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements . aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society , and that although private property is often blamed for social strife , such evils in fact come from human nature . in politics , aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money . money came into use because people became dependent on one another , importing what they needed and exporting the surplus . for the sake of convenience , people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable , such as iron or silver .
aristotle's discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the middle ages . he had a low opinion of retail , believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household , retail trade seeks to make a profit . it thus uses goods as a means to an end , rather than as an end unto itself . he believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural . similarly , aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural , as it makes a gain out of the money itself , and not from its use .
aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time . he wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth , the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement . money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them " commensurable ". he goes to on state that money is also useful for future exchange , making it a sort of security . that is , " if we do not want a thing now , we shall be able to get it when we do want it ".

rhetoric and poetics

aristotle's rhetoric proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience : ethos ( an appeal to the speaker's character ), pathos ( an appeal to the audience's emotion ), and logos ( an appeal to logical reasoning ). he also categorises rhetoric into three genres : epideictic ( ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame ), forensic ( judicial speeches over guilt or innocence ), and deliberative ( speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue ). aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs : enthymeme ( proof by syllogism ) and paradeigma ( proof by example ).
aristotle writes in his poetics that epic poetry , tragedy , comedy , dithyrambic poetry , painting , sculpture , music , and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis (" imitation "), each varying in imitation by medium , object , and manner . he applies the term mimesis both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist's intention and contends that the audience's realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself . aristotle states that mimesis is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry " follows the pattern of nature ". because of this , aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what stephen halliwell calls " highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes ." for example , music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony , whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone , and poetry with language . the forms also differ in their object of imitation . comedy , for instance , is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average ; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average . lastly , the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama .
while it is believed that aristotle's poetics originally comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived . aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements : plot - structure , character , style , thought , spectacle , and lyric poetry . the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story ; and the plot , not the characters , is the chief focus of tragedy . tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear , and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions . aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which , if either , is superior : epic or tragic mimesis . he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic , possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music , is more unified , and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope , it can be considered superior to epic . aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles , folklore , and proverbs ; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop .

views on women

aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active , ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert , passive female element . on this ground , proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism . however , aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's , and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men .

influence

more than 2300 years after his death , aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived . he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence , and he was the founder of many new fields . according to the philosopher bryan magee , " it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did ". among countless other achievements , aristotle was the founder of formal logic , pioneered the study of zoology , and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method . taneli kukkonen , writing in the classical tradition , observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched , and his reach in influencing " every branch of intellectual enterprise " including western ethical and political theory , theology , rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long . as a result , kukkonen argues , any analysis of reality today " will almost certainly carry aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind ." jonathan barnes wrote that " an account of aristotle's intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of european thought ".

on his successor , theophrastus

aristotle's pupil and successor , theophrastus , wrote the history of plants , a pioneering work in botany . some of his technical terms remain in use , such as carpel from carpos , fruit , and pericarp , from pericarpion , seed chamber .
theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than aristotle was , instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned .

on later greek philosophers

the immediate influence of aristotle's work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school . aristotle's notable students included aristoxenus , dicaearchus , demetrius of phalerum , eudemos of rhodes , harpalus , hephaestion , mnason of phocis , nicomachus , and theophrastus . aristotle's influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists , botanists , and researchers . he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher . although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle's geography was clearly wrong , when the old philosopher released his works to the public , alexander complained " thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines ; for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all men's common property ?"

on hellenistic science

after theophrastus , the lyceum failed to produce any original work . though interest in aristotle's ideas survived , they were generally taken unquestioningly . it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found .
the first medical teacher at alexandria , herophilus of chalcedon , corrected aristotle , placing intelligence in the brain , and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation . herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries , noting that the latter pulse while the former do not . though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life , teleology ( and after the rise of christianity , natural theology ) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries . ernst mayr states that there was " nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance ."

on byzantine scholars

greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus . the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were philoponus , elias , and david in the sixth century , and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century . john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotle's views on the eternity of the world , movement , and other elements of aristotelian thought . philoponus questioned aristotle's teaching of physics , noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations .
after a hiatus of several centuries , formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries , apparently sponsored by anna comnena .

on the medieval islamic world

aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology . most of the still extant works of aristotle , as well as a number of the original greek commentaries , were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers , scientists and scholars . averroes , avicenna and alpharabius , who wrote on aristotle in great depth , also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers . alkindus considered aristotle the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the " exemplar " for all future philosophers . medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the " first teacher ". the title " teacher " was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars , and was later used by western philosophers ( as in the famous poem of dante ) who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy .
in accordance with the greek theorists , the muslims considered aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher , the author of a closed system , and believed that aristotle shared with plato essential tenets of thought . some went so far as to credit aristotle himself with neo - platonic metaphysical ideas .

on medieval europe

with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west , aristotle was practically unknown there from c . ad 600 to c . 1100 except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius . in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made , both from arabic translations , such as those by gerard of cremona , and from the original greek , such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke . after the scholastic thomas aquinas wrote his summa theologica , working from moerbeke's translations and calling aristotle " the philosopher ", the demand for aristotle's writings grew , and the greek manuscripts returned to the west , stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance . these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity , bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages . scholars such as boethius , peter abelard , and john buridan worked on aristotelian logic .
the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having
a cautionary medieval tale held that aristotle advised his pupil alexander to avoid the king's seductive mistress , phyllis , but was himself captivated by her , and allowed her to ride him . phyllis had secretly told alexander what to expect , and he witnessed phyllis proving that a woman's charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher's male intellect . artists such as hans baldung produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme .
the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the divine comedy :

on early modern scientists

in the early modern period , scientists such as william harvey in england and galileo galilei in italy reacted against the theories of aristotle and other classical era thinkers like galen , establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment . harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood , establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body's heat , as aristotle thought . galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace aristotle's physics , proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight .

on 19th - century thinkers

the 19th - century german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle . aristotle rigidly separated action from production , and argued for the deserved subservience of some people (" natural slaves "), and the natural superiority ( virtue , arete ) of others . it was martin heidegger , not nietzsche , who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle , intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition .
the english mathematician george boole fully accepted aristotle's logic , but decided " to go under , over , and beyond " it with his system of algebraic logic in his 1854 book the laws of thought . this gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations , enables it to solve equations as well as check validity , and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms , not just two .

modern rejection and rehabilitation

during the 20th century , aristotle's work was widely criticised . the philosopher bertrand russell
argued that " almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine ". russell called aristotle's ethics " repulsive ", and labelled his logic " as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy ". russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle , until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors . in 1985 , the biologist peter medawar could still state in " pure seventeenth century " tones that aristotle had assembled " a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay , imperfect observation , wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility ".
by the start of the 21st century , however , aristotle was taken more seriously : kukkonen noted that " in the best 20th - century scholarship aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the greek philosophical tradition ." ayn rand accredited aristotle as " the greatest philosopher in history " and cited him as a major influence on her thinking . more recently , alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti - elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans . kukkonen observed , too , that " that most enduring of romantic images , aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander " remained current , as in the 2004 film alexander , while the " firm rules " of aristotle's theory of drama have ensured a role for the poetics in hollywood .
biologists continue to be interested in aristotle's thinking . armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotle's biology , while niko tinbergen's four questions , based on aristotle's four causes , are used to analyse animal behaviour ; they examine function , phylogeny , mechanism , and ontogeny .

surviving works


corpus aristotelicum

the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum . these texts , as opposed to aristotle's lost works , are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotle's school . reference to them is made according to the organisation of immanuel bekker's royal prussian academy edition ( aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica , berlin , 1831 – 1870 ), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works .

loss and preservation

aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls , the common writing medium of that era . his writings are divisible into two groups : the " exoteric ", intended for the public , and the " esoteric ", for use within the lyceum school . aristotle's " lost " works stray considerably in characterisation from the surviving aristotelian corpus . whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication , the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication . cicero's description of aristotle's literary style as " a river of gold " must have applied to the published works , not the surviving notes . a major question in the history of aristotle's works is how the exoteric writings were all lost , and how the ones we now possess came to us . the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller , separate works , distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics , edited them , and finally compiled them into the more cohesive , larger works as they are known today .

legacy


depictions

aristotle has been depicted by major artists including lucas cranach the elder , justus van gent , raphael , paolo veronese , jusepe de ribera , rembrandt , and francesco hayez over the centuries . among the best - known is raphael's fresco the school of athens , in the vatican's apostolic palace , where the figures of plato and aristotle are central to the image , at the architectural vanishing point , reflecting their importance . rembrandt's aristotle with a bust of homer , too , is a celebrated work , showing the knowing philosopher and the blind homer from an earlier age : as the art critic jonathan jones writes , " this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world , ensnaring us in its musty , glowing , pitch - black , terrible knowledge of time ."

eponyms

the aristotle mountains in antarctica are named after aristotle . he was the first person known to conjecture , in his book meteorology , the existence of a landmass in the southern high - latitude region and called it antarctica . aristoteles is a crater on the moon bearing the classical form of aristotle's name .

an american in paris
an american in paris is a jazz - influenced orchestral piece by american composer george gershwin written in 1928 . it was inspired by the time that gershwin had spent in paris and evokes the sights and energy of the french capital in the 1920s .
gershwin composed an american in paris on commission from conductor walter damrosch . he scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta , saxophones , and automobile horns . he brought back some parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition , which took place on december 13 , 1928 in carnegie hall , with damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic . he completed the orchestration on november 18 , less than four weeks before the work's premiere . he collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer deems taylor .

background

gershwin was attracted by maurice ravel's unusual chords , and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in 1926 ready to study with ravel . after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories , ravel said he could not teach him , saying , " why be a second - rate ravel when you can be a first - rate gershwin ?" while the studies were cut short , that 1926 trip resulted in a piece entitled " very parisienne ", the initial version of an american in paris , written as a ' thank you note ' to gershwin's hosts , robert and mabel shirmer . gershwin called it " a rhapsodic ballet "; it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works .
gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour . to this end , upon his return to new york , gershwin joined the efforts of ravel's friend robert schmitz , a pianist ravel had met during the war , to urge ravel to tour the u.s . schmitz was the head of pro musica , promoting franco - american musical relations , and was able to offer ravel a 10,000 fee for the tour , an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel .

gershwin greeted ravel in new york in march 1928 during a party held for ravel's birthday by éva gauthier . ravel's tour reignited gershwin's desire to return to paris which he and his brother ira did after meeting ravel . ravel's high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to nadia boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris . yet after playing for her , she told him she could not teach him . nadia boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students : " what could i give you that you haven't already got ?" this did not set gershwin back , as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue . paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers , among them ezra pound , w . b . yeats , ernest hemingway ; and artist pablo picasso .

composition

gershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called " very parisienne ", written in 1926 on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts , robert and mabel schirmer . he described the piece as a " rhapsodic ballet " because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works . gershwin explained in musical america , " my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city , listens to the various street noises , and absorbs the french atmosphere ."
the piece is structured into five sections , which culminate in a loose aba format . gershwin's first a episode introduces the two main " walking " themes in the " allegretto grazioso " and develops a third theme in the " subito con brio ". the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six . this a section featured duple meter , singsong rhythms , and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe , english horn , and taxi horns . the b section's " andante ma con ritmo deciso " introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness . the " allegro " that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve - bar blues . in the b section , gershwin uses common time , syncopated rhythms , and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet , saxophone , and snare drum . " moderato con grazia " is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a . after recapitulating the " walking " themes , gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final " grandioso ".

instrumentation

an american in paris is scored for 3 flutes ( 3rd doubling on piccolo ), 2 oboes , english horn , 2 clarinets in b - flat , bass clarinet in b - flat , 2 bassoons , 4 horns in f , 3 trumpets in b - flat , 3 trombones , tuba , timpani , snare drum , bass drum , triangle , wood block , cymbals , low and high tom - toms , xylophone , glockenspiel , celesta , 4 taxi horns labeled as a , b , c and d with circles around them , alto saxophone / soprano saxophone , tenor saxophone / soprano saxophone / alto saxophone , baritone saxophone / soprano saxophone / alto saxophone , and strings . although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes a , b , c and d , it has recently come to light that gershwin's intention was to have used the notes a4 , b4 , d5 , and a4 . it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as a , b , c and d with circles , he may have been referring to the use of the four different horns and not the notes that they played .
the revised edition by f . campbell - watson calls for three saxophones , alto , tenor and baritone . in this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments . in 2000 , gershwin specialist jack gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of an american in paris , working directly from gershwin's original manuscript , including the restoration of gershwin's soprano saxophone parts removed in f . campbell - watson's revision ; gibbons ' restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at london's queen elizabeth hall on july 9 , 2000 by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian
william daly arranged the score for piano solo which was published by new world music in 1929 .

response

gershwin did not particularly like walter damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris . he stated that damrosch's sluggish , dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work . the audience , according to edward cushing , responded with " a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music , good and bad , ordinarily arouses ." critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than his lukewarm concerto in f . some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers césar franck , richard wagner , or guillaume lekeu on its premiere . gershwin responded to the critics , " it's not a beethoven symphony , you know ... it's a humorous piece , nothing solemn about it . it's not intended to draw tears . if it pleases symphony audiences as a light , jolly piece , a series of impressions musically expressed , it succeeds ."

preservation status

on september 22 , 2013 , it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score will be eventually released . the gershwin family , working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan , are working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwin's true intent . it is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work ( such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section ), or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during gershwin's composition process .
the score to an american in paris is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released . the entire project may take 30 to 40 years to complete , but an american in paris will be an early volume in the series .
two urtext editions of the work have been published by the german publisher b - note music in 2015 . the changes made by campbell - watson have been withdrawn in both editions . in the extended urtext , 120 bars of music have been re - integrated . conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance .

recordings

an american in paris has been frequently recorded . the first recording was made for rca victor in 1929 with nathaniel shilkret conducting the rca victor symphony orchestra , drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra . gershwin was on hand to " supervise " the recording ; however , shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio . then , a little later , shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section , so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo ; gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording . this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes a flat , b flat , a higher c and a lower d . the radio broadcast of the september 8 , 1937 hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert , in which an american in paris , also conducted by shilkret , was second on the program , was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two - cd set . arthur fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor , including one of the first stereo recordings of the music . in 1945 , arturo toscanini conducting the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the piece for rca victor , one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer . the seattle symphony also recorded a version in 1990 of gershwin's original score , before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today . harry james released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album one night stand , recorded live at the aragon ballroom in chicago ( columbia gl 522 and cl 522 ).

use in film

in 1951 , metro - goldwyn - mayer released the musical film an american in paris , featuring gene kelly and leslie caron . winning the 1951 best picture oscar and numerous other awards , the film was directed by vincente minnelli , featured many tunes of gershwin , and concluded with an extensive , elaborate dance sequence built around the an american in paris symphonic poem ( arranged for the film by johnny green ), costing 500,000 .

academy awards
the academy awards , also known as the oscars , are a set of 24 awards for artistic and technical merit in the film industry , given annually by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ( ampas ), to recognize excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the academy's voting membership . the various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette , officially called the " academy award of merit ", although more commonly referred to by its nickname " oscar ". the award was originally sculpted by george stanley from a design sketch by cedric gibbons . ampas first presented it in 1929 at a private dinner hosted by douglas fairbanks in the hollywood roosevelt hotel .
the academy awards ceremony was first broadcast on radio in 1930 and televised for the first time in 1953 . it is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now seen live worldwide . its equivalents – the emmy awards for television , the tony awards for theater , and the grammy awards for music – are modeled after the academy awards .
the 90th academy awards ceremony , honoring the best films of 2017 , was held on 4 march 2018 , at the dolby theatre , in los angeles , california . the ceremony was hosted by jimmy kimmel and was broadcast on abc . a total of 3,072 oscars have been awarded from the inception of the award through the 90th .

history

the first academy awards presentation was held on 16 may 1929 , at a private dinner function at the hollywood roosevelt hotel with an audience of about 270 people . the post - awards party was held at the mayfair hotel . the cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was 5 ( in dollars ). fifteen statuettes were awarded , honoring artists , directors and other participants in the film - making industry of the time , for their works during the 1927 – 28 period . the ceremony ran for 15 minutes .
winners were announced to media three months earlier . that was changed for the second ceremony in 1930 . since then , for the rest of the first decade , the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 : 00 pm on the night of the awards . this method was used until an occasion when the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began ; as a result , the academy has , since 1941 , used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners .

institutions

the first best actor awarded was emil jannings , for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh . he had to return to europe before the ceremony , so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier ; this made him the first academy award winner in history . at that time , the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period ; for example , jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period , and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films . with the fourth ceremony , however , the system changed , and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film . for the first six ceremonies , the eligibility period spanned two calendar years .
at the 29th ceremony , held on 27 march 1957 , the best foreign language film category was introduced . until then , foreign - language films had been honored with the special achievement award .
the 74th academy awards , held in 2002 , presented the first academy award for best animated feature .
since 1973 , all academy awards ceremonies have ended with the academy award for best picture .
traditionally , the previous year's winner for best actor and best supporting actor present the awards for best actress and best supporting actress , while the previous year's winner for best actress and best supporting actress present the awards for best actor and best supporting actor .

oscar statuette


academy award of merit ( oscar statuette )

see also ( below )
the best known award is the academy award of merit , more popularly known as the oscar statuette . made of gold - plated bronze on a black metal base , it is 13.5 in ( 34.3 cm ) tall , weighs 8.5 lb ( 3.856 kg ), and depicts a knight rendered in art deco style holding a crusader's sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes . the five spokes represent the original branches of the academy : actors , writers , directors , producers , and technicians .
the model for the statuette is said to be mexican actor emilio " el indio " fernández . sculptor george stanley ( who also did the muse fountain at the hollywood bowl ) sculpted cedric gibbons ' design . the statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold - plated solid bronze . within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal , a pewter - like alloy which is then plated in copper , nickel silver , and finally , 24 - karat gold . due to a metal shortage during world war ii , oscars were made of painted plaster for three years . following the war , the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold - plated metal ones . the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base . the original oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the c.w . shumway & sons foundry in batavia , illinois , which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy award's statuettes . from 1983 to 2015 , approximately 50 oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer r.s . owens & company . it would take between three and four weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes .
in 2016 , the academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes , handing manufacturing duties to walden , new york - based polich tallix fine art foundry . while based on a digital scan of an original 1929 oscar , the statuettes retain their modern - era dimensions and black pedestal . cast in liquid bronze from 3d - printed ceramic molds and polished , they are then electroplated in 24 - karat gold by brooklyn , new york – based epner technology . the time required to produce 50 such statuettes is roughly three months . r.s . owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the academy and service existing oscars that need replating .

naming

the origin of the name oscar is disputed . one biography of bette davis , who was a president of the academy , claims she named the oscar after her first husband , band leader harmon oscar nelson . another claimed origin is the academy's executive secretary , margaret herrick , who , when she first saw the award in 1931 , made reference to the statuette's reminding her of her " uncle oscar " ( a nickname for her cousin oscar pierce ). columnist sidney skolsky was present during herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline , " employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette ' oscar '."
one of the earliest mentions of the term oscar dates to a time magazine article about the 1934 6th academy awards . walt disney also thanked the academy for his oscar as early as 1932 . the trophy officially received the name " oscar " in 1939 by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences .

engraving

to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony , oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates . until 2010 , winners returned their statuettes to the academy , and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective oscars . since 2010 , winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription - processing station at the governor's ball , a party held immediately after the oscar ceremony . the r.s . owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony , bearing the name of every potential winner . the nameplates for the non - winning nominees are later recycled .

ownership of oscar statuettes

since 1950 , the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the academy for us 1 . if a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation , then the academy keeps the statuette . academy awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six - figure sums . in december 2011 , orson welles ' 1941 oscar for citizen kane ( academy award for best original screenplay ) was put up for auction , after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy . on 20 december 2011 , it sold in an online auction for us 861,542 .
in 1992 , harold russell needed money for his wife's medical expenses . in a controversial decision , he consigned his 1946 oscar for best supporting actor for the best years of our lives to herman darvick autograph auctions , and on 6 august 1992 , in new york city , the oscar sold to a private collector for 60,500 . since he won the award before 1950 , he was not required to offer it to the academy first . russell defended his decision , saying , " i don't know why anybody would be critical . my wife's health is much more important than sentimental reasons . the movie will be here , even if oscar isn't ." harold russell is the only academy award - winning actor to ever sell an oscar .
while the oscar is owned by the recipient , it is essentially not on the open market . michael todd's grandson tried to sell todd's oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989 , but the academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction . although some oscar sales transactions have been successful , some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the academy , which keeps them in its treasury .

nomination

since 2004 , academy award nomination results have been announced to the public in mid - january . prior to that , the results were announced in early february .

voters

the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ( ampas ), a professional honorary organization , maintains a voting membership of over 8,000 .
academy membership is divided into different branches , with each representing a different discipline in film production . actors constitute the largest voting bloc , numbering 1,311 members ( 22 percent ) of the academy's composition . votes have been certified by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers ( and its predecessor price waterhouse ) for the past 83 annual awards ceremonies . the firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the academy in december to reflect the previous eligible year with a due date sometime in january of the next year , then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours .
all ampas members must be invited to join by the board of governors , on behalf of academy branch executive committees . membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures .
new membership proposals are considered annually . the academy does not publicly disclose its membership , although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join . the 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members . while the membership had been growing , stricter policies have kept its size steady since then .
in 2012 , the results of a study conducted by the los angeles times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88 % of ampas ' voting membership . of the 5,100 active voters confirmed , 94 % were caucasian , 77 % were male , and 54 % were found to be over the age of 60 . 33 % of voting members are former nominees ( 14 %) and winners ( 19 %).
in may 2011 , the academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting would be implemented in 2013 .

rules

according to rules 2 and 3 of the official academy awards rules , a film must open in the previous calendar year , from midnight at the start of 1 january to midnight at the end of 31 december , in los angeles county , california , and play for seven consecutive days , to qualify ( except for the best foreign language film , best documentary feature , and best documentary short subject ).
the best foreign language film award does not require a u.s . release . it requires the film to be submitted as its country's official selection .
the best documentary feature award requires either week - long releases in both los angeles county and new york city during the previous calendar year , or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the documentary feature qualifying festival list ( regardless of any public exhibition or distribution ), or a submission in the foreign language film category as its country's official selection .
the best documentary short subject award has noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards . first , the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year , instead covering a one - year period starting on 1 september and ending on 31 august of the calendar year before the ceremony . second , there are multiple methods of qualification . the main method is a week - long theatrical release in either los angeles county or new york city during the eligibility period . films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of a number of competitive film festivals designated by the academy . finally , a film that is selected as a gold , silver , or bronze medal winner in the documentary category of the immediately previous student academy awards is also eligible .
for example , the 2009 best picture winner , the hurt locker , was actually first released in 2008 , but did not qualify for the 2008 awards as it did not play its oscar - qualifying run in los angeles until mid - 2009 , thus qualifying for the 2009 awards . foreign films must include english subtitles , and each country can submit only one film per year .
rule 2 states that a film must be feature - length , defined as a minimum of 40 minutes , except for short - subject awards , and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24 frame / s or 48 frame / s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels . effective with the 90th academy awards , presented in 2018 , multi - part and limited series will be ineligible for the best documentary feature award . this followed the win of made in america , an eight - hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on abc and espn , in that category in 2017 . the academy's announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film .
producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline ; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline , the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year . the form includes the production credits for all related categories . then , each form is checked and put in a reminder list of eligible releases .
in late december ballots and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members . for most categories , members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories ( i.e . only directors vote for directors , writers for writers , actors for actors , etc .). in the special case of best picture , all voting members are eligible to select the nominees . in all major categories , a variant of the single transferable vote is used , with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees ( ten for best picture ) ranked preferentially . in certain categories , including foreign film , documentary and animated feature , nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches .
in most categories the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members . since 2009 , the best picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting . since 2013 , re - weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the best visual effects .
film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture , in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season . the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified . it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders . for example , a producer of the 2009 best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front - runner ( the hurt locker eventually won ).

awards ceremonies


telecast

the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony , commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year , and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees . it is the culmination of the film awards season , which usually begins during november or december of the previous year . this is an elaborate extravaganza , with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day . black tie dress is the most common outfit for men , although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow - tie , and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this . ( the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony , and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast .)
the academy awards is the only awards show televised live in all united states time zones ( excluding hawaii ), canada , and the united kingdom , and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world . the oscars were first televised in 1953 by nbc , which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 , when abc took over , televising the festivities ( including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966 ) through 1970 . nbc regained the rights for five years then abc resumed broadcast duties in 1976 and its current contract with the academy runs through 2028 . the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets ( especially those outside of the americas ) in more desirable local timeslots . the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970 , but only two south american countries , chile and brazil , purchased the rights to air the broadcast . by that time , the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in 50 countries . a decade later , the rights were already being sold to 60 countries , and by 1984 , the tv rights to the awards were licensed in 76 countries .
the ceremonies were moved up from late march / early april to late february since 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry . another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success coinciding with the ncaa basketball tournament , which would cut into the academy awards audience . ( in 1976 and 1977 , abc's regained oscars were moved from tuesday to monday and went directly opposite nbc's ncaa title game .) the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc , as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period . some years , the ceremony is moved into first sunday of march in order to avoid clash with the winter olympic games . another reason for the move to late february and early march is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter , which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public . advertising is somewhat restricted , however , as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast . the production of the academy awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most emmys in history , with 47 wins and 195 nominations overall since that award's own launch in 1949 .
after many years of being held on mondays at 9 : 00 pm eastern / 6 : 00 p.m pacific , since the 1999 ceremonies , it was moved to sundays at 8 : 30 pm et / 5 : 30 pm pt . the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays , that los angeles rush - hour traffic jams could be avoided , and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier . for many years the film industry opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office . in 2010 , the academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january , citing tv viewers ' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season . however , such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members , to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers ( as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail ). furthermore , a january ceremony on sunday would clash with national football league playoff games . in 2018 , the academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late february to mid february beginning with the 92nd academy awards in 2020 .
originally scheduled for 8 april 1968 , the 40th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days , because of the assassination of dr . martin luther king , jr .. on 30 march 1981 , the 53rd academy awards was postponed for one day , after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington , d.c .
in 1993 , an in memoriam segment was introduced , honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months , a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members . this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names . criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect , with the segment having a " popularity contest " feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject's cultural impact ; the applause has since been muted during the telecast , and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead .
in terms of broadcast length , the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours . the first oscars , in 1929 , lasted 15 minutes . at the other end of the spectrum , the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty - three minutes . in 2010 , the organizers of the academy awards announced winners ' acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds . this , according to organizer bill mechanic , was to ensure the elimination of what he termed " the single most hated thing on the show " – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion . in 2016 , in a further effort to streamline speeches , winners ' dedications were displayed on an on - screen ticker . during the 2018 ceremony , host jimmy kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become , by announcing that he would give a brand - new jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night ( a reward won by mark bridges when accepting his best costume design award for phantom thread ).
although still dominant in ratings , the viewership of the academy awards have steadily dropped ; the 88th academy awards were the lowest - rated in the past eight years ( although with increases in male and 18 - 49 viewership ), while the show itself also faced mixed reception . following the show , variety reported that abc was , in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars , seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself . currently and nominally , ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast , including the choice of production staff and hosting , although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions . in august 2016 , ampas extended its contract with abc through 2028 : the contract neither contains any notable changes , nor gives abc any further creative control over the telecast .

tv ratings

historically , the " oscarcast " has pulled in a bigger haul when box - office hits are favored to win the best picture trophy . more than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th academy awards in 1998 , the year of titanic , which generated close to us 600 million at the north american box office pre - oscars . the 76th academy awards ceremony in which the return of the king ( pre - telecast box office earnings of us 368 million ) received 11 awards including best picture drew 43.56 million viewers . the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date , however , was the 42nd academy awards ( best picture midnight cowboy ) which drew a 43.4 % household rating on 7 april 1970 .
by contrast , ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings . the 78th academy awards which awarded low - budgeted , independent film crash ( with a pre - oscar gross of us 53.4 million ) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91 %. in 2008 , the 80th academy awards telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66 % household rating , the lowest rated and least watched ceremony at the time , in spite of celebrating 80 years of the academy awards . the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film ( no country for old men ).

venues

in 1929 , the first academy awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel . from 1930 to 1943 , the ceremony alternated between two venues : the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles .
grauman's chinese theatre in hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946 , followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from 1947 to 1948 . the 21st academy awards in 1949 were held at the academy award theatre at what was the academy's headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood .
from 1950 to 1960 , the awards were presented at hollywood's pantages theatre . with the advent of television , the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york , first at the nbc international theatre ( 1953 ) and then at the nbc century theatre , after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles . the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica , california in 1961 . by 1969 , the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to los angeles , this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center . some years , the ceremony were at shriners auditorium by usc .
in 2002 , the dolby theatre ( previously known as the kodak theatre ) became the presentation's current venue .

awards of merit categories


current categories

in the first year of the awards , the best directing award was split into two categories ( drama and comedy ). at times , the best original score award has also been split into separate categories ( drama and comedy / musical ). from the 1930s through the 1960s , the art direction ( now production design ), cinematography , and costume design awards were likewise split into two categories ( black - and - white films and color films ). prior to 2012 , the production design award was called art direction , while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup .

criticism


accusations of commercialism

due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards , many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the " oscar season ". this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than quality . william friedkin , an academy award - winning film director and former producer of the ceremony , expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in 2009 , describing it as " the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself ".
tim dirks , editor of amc's filmsite.org , has written of the academy awards ,

accusations of bias

typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over - representation of romantic historical epics , biographical dramas , romantic dramedies , and family melodramas , most of which are released in the u.s . the last three months of the calendar year . the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded . this has led to the coining of the term ' oscar bait ', describing such movies . this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience , e.g ., by favoring ' oscar bait ' over audience favorites , or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues .

allegations of a lack of diversity

the academy awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees . this criticism is based on the statistics from every academy awards since 1929 which shows us that only 6.4 % of academy award nominees have been non - white and since 1991 , 11.2 % of nominees have been non - white , with the rate of winners being even more polarizing . the 88th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott , popularized on social media by the # oscarssowhite , based on critics ' perception that its all - white acting nominee list reflected bias . in response , the academy initiated " historic " changes in membership by the year 2020 .

symbolism or sentimentalization

acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity or presented as a " career honor " to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work .

refusing the award

some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars . the first to do so was screenwriter dudley nichols ( best writing in 1935 for the informer ). nichols boycotted the 8th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers ' guild . nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later , at the 1938 ceremony . nichols was nominated for three further academy awards during his career .
george c . scott became the second person to refuse his award ( best actor in 1970 for patton ) at the 43rd academy awards ceremony . scott described it as a " meat parade ", saying " i don't want any part of it ."
the third person to refuse the award was marlon brando , who refused his award ( best actor for 1972 ' s the godfather ) citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of native americans . at the 45th academy awards ceremony , brando sent actress and civil rights activist sacheen littlefeather to read a 15 - page speech detailing his criticisms .

incidents

at the 89th academy awards ceremony , warren beatty and faye dunaway mistakenly announced la la land as the recipient of the best picture award , instead of moonlight , the actual winner . beatty had been given the wrong envelope and after hesitating during the announcement , handed the envelope to dunaway , which listed emma stone as best actress for la la land and led to the confusion . the proper winner was announced after the acceptance speeches by la la land producers fred berger , jordan horowitz and marc platt .
the following year , beatty and dunaway were invited back as presenters of the best picture award , which they accomplished without error .

presenter and performer gifts

it has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the oscars . in recent years , these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners . the value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars . in 2014 , the value was reported to be as high as us 80,000 . the value has risen to the point where the u.s . internal revenue service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status .
